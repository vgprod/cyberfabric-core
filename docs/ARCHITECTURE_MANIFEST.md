# HyperSpot Architecture Manifest

> **NOTE:** This manifest describes our targets and forward-looking architecture. It is not a changelog of the current implementation. Canonical, up-to-date product and API documentation is maintained separately (e.g., module-specific docs, OpenAPI, and design records). Use this document for intent and direction; confirm current behavior in the dedicated docs.

**Welcome to HyperSpot!** This document serves as your architectural and technical reference, explaining the core ideas, design principles, and rules that guide HyperSpot's development. Whether you're a newcomer or contributor, understanding these concepts will help you navigate and extend the platform effectively.

HyperSpot is a modular Rust-based foundation for building SaaS products where Generative AI capabilities are first-class, alongside enterprise-grade SaaS requirements such as multi-tenancy, access control, governance, auditability, and usage tracking. It is designed to sit between cloud infrastructure (IaaS/PaaS) and vendor-developed SaaS applications, providing reusable building blocks that product teams can assemble into complete end-to-end services.

## Overview

HyperSpot is a **modular, high-performance AI services platform** built in Rust. It provides a framework for building scalable and highly-customizable AI applications with automatic REST API generation, OpenAPI documentation, and a flexible modular architecture.

**Key Philosophy:**
- **Modular by Design**: Everything is a Module - composable, independent units with plugin patterns for pluggable workers
- **Extensible at Every Level**: [GTS](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-spec)-powered extension points for custom data types, business logic, and third-party integrations
- **SaaS Ready**: Multi-tenancy, granular access control, usage tracking, and tenant customization built-in
- **Cloud Operations Excellence**: Production-grade observability, database agnostic design, API best practices, and resilience patterns via ModKit
- **Quality First**: 90%+ test coverage target with unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security testing
- **Universal Deployment**: Single codebase runs on cloud, on-prem Windows/Linux workstation, or mobile
- **Developer Friendly**: AI-assisted code generation, automatic OpenAPI docs, DDD-light structure, and type-safe APIs

## Non-goals

1. HyperSpot doesn't optimize for **minimalism** or the lowest barrier to entry

HyperSpot does not aim to be the simplest or smallest framework for building SaaS or AI applications. It intentionally prioritizes explicit structure, governance, composability, and long-term evolvability over quick-start simplicity or minimal configuration.

2. HyperSpot doesn't Provide a **rich catalog of end-user services** out of the box

HyperSpot does not aim to ship a comprehensive set of ready-made, end-user SaaS services (e.g. CRM, ticketing, billing products) as part of its core. Its primary focus is the foundational layer—runtime, control plane, GenAI capabilities, workflows, and extensibility—on top of which vendors and product teams build their own complete SaaS offerings.

3. HyperSpot doesn't attempt to replace **cloud infrastructure or PaaS layers**

HyperSpot is not a replacement for cloud providers or infrastructure platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem orchestration stacks. It does not offer physical infrastructure, networking, container orchestration, or low-level resource scheduling. Instead, HyperSpot intentionally positions itself above IaaS/PaaS and below vendor-developed SaaS, focusing on application-level services, governance, and GenAI enablement.

## Why Rust and why Monorepo?

Rust and a monorepo are intentional choices to optimize **recurring engineering work**,especially the feedback loop required for safe and high-throughput **LLM-assisted development**. The goal is to maximize how quickly generated code can be validated (build, lint, test, run, debug) *before* it is committed.

### Why Rust (recurring benefits)

- **Compile-time safety for memory and concurrency**.
  Rust's ownership model prevents data races and memory safety issues by construction. It removes entire categories of runtime failures (null pointer dereference, use-after-free, iterator invalidation) by design—critical for a multi-tenant platform handling concurrent requests.

- **Faster debugging of complex, cross-cutting scenarios (human + LLM)**.
  Strong typing, structured errors, and deterministic build artifacts make failures easier to localize. This improves troubleshooting for complex, multi-module behaviors and makes it easier for LLMs to propose minimal, correct fixes based on compiler diagnostics, test failures, and traces.

- **Deep static analysis as a platform feature**.
  Rust's compiler and tooling ecosystem enable strong static inspection (AST/HIR/MIR-level analysis). Over time, recurring code review feedback and internal guidelines can be converted into custom project-specific lints (see [dylint_lints](../tools/dylint_lints)), preventing bad patterns *before* they reach code review or production.

- **Low footprint + performance enable “whole subsystem locally” workflows**.
  A fast, resource-efficient stack makes it realistic for developers (and LLM-based code generators) to:
  - build and run large subsystems locally (e.g. via Docker Compose),
  - run end-to-end tests locally,
  - reproduce issues with full logs + source access without relying on remote environments.

- **Fearless refactoring**.
  Strong type system and exhaustive pattern matching mean large-scale refactors (e.g., changing a contract used by 20 modules) are caught at compile time, not in production.

### Why a monorepo (recurring benefits)

- **Atomic changes across modules and contracts**.
  HyperSpot is modular, but the contracts between modules evolve. A monorepo allows changing a contract and all its consumers in one PR.

- **Short, controllable feedback loops for LLM-generated changes**.
  When generation touches multiple crates, the monorepo makes it practical to run build + lints + targeted tests + E2E in a single workspace context. This reduces "partial correctness" changes and enables rapid iteration on generated patches until the full system is green.

- **Single source of truth for tooling and quality gates**.
  Consistent formatting, linting, security checks, and test entry points are easier to enforce when everything shares the same CI and build system.

- **Realistic local builds and end-to-end testing**.
  When the code is together, it is much easier to run “the full actual system” locally, which is a prerequisite for fast debugging and reliable local E2E.

- **Avoid version skew between internal crates/services**.
  Multi-repos often introduce dependency pinning, release choreography, and integration lag. A monorepo keeps internal APIs aligned by default.

Monorepo is not dogma: it has to be kept while it improves velocity and correctness. If a part of the system grows to the point where independent versioning, release cadence, or access control is required, it can be extracted behind stable contracts.

## 1. Modular Architecture

### 1.1. What is a Module?

A **Module** is a logical component that provides a specific set of functionality. In HyperSpot:
- Every logical component must be a module
- Each module is a Rust **package** containing:
  - A **library crate** (`lib.rs`) — always present, contains module declaration
  - Optionally a **binary crate** (`main.rs`) — for out-of-process (OoP) modules that run as separate processes
- Modules are self-contained with their own configuration, API, and business logic
- Modules are discovered automatically via the `inventory` crate
- Modules can depend on each other
- Modules can run either **in-process** (linked into the main binary) or **out-of-process** (as separate binaries communicating via gRPC) — see [MODKIT UNIFIED SYSTEM](modkit_unified_system/README.md) for OoP details

**Example modules:**
- `file-parser` - Document parsing and extraction
- `chat` - Chat module
- `web_search` - Web search module

**Module categories**

- **Regular Module** — Regular modules are typically independent, expose their own versioned public API, and are responsible for their own domain end-to-end, including module business logic, data storage, migrations, and module API documentation. Regular modules **cannot** depend on or consume plugin modules directly—all plugin functionality must be accessed through the main module's public API.
- **Module with plugins** — Modules with plugins are Regular Modules that define a **plugin contract** and route requests to one or more Plugin Modules at runtime. They expose a public API and delegate execution to the selected plugin based on configuration or context. See [MODKIT_PLUGINS.md](MODKIT_PLUGINS.md) for the Module + Plugin pattern.
- **Plugin Module** — Plugins are special modules identified by a **GTS instance ID** that implement a module-defined contract. They do not expose their own **public API** and act as pluggable workers. Plugins register themselves in the types-registry for runtime discovery — see [MODKIT_PLUGINS.md](MODKIT_PLUGINS.md) for details.

**Module structure:**

| Module layer | Regular module | Module with plugins | Plugin module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API layer @ api/ | Yes | Yes | No |
| Business logic layer @ domain/ | Yes | Yes (contract, router) | Yes, main logic |
| Infrastructure layer @ infrastructure/ | Likely | Rare | Likely |
| Gateway layer @ gateways/ | Yes, if depends on other modules | Yes, workers connectors | Yes, clients to some service |
| Examples | Any CRUD module (TODO) | file-parser, (TODO) | file-parser-tika, (TODO) |

See below typical modules categories, internal layout and typical modules relationship:

![module_structure.png](img/module_categories.drawio.png)

See more in [MODKIT UNIFIED SYSTEM](modkit_unified_system/README.md)

### 1.2. Deployment Units

A **Deployment Unit** is a physical component that bundles one or more modules for deployment:
- **Desktop app**: Most modules compiled into a single process
- **Cloud server**: Modules compiled into separate processes and running in separate Docker containers
- **On-prem server**: Modules compiled into several Windows/Linux binaries
- **Mobile app**: Selected modules in-app, others in the cloud

### 1.3. Module Communication

Modules interact using **native Rust APIs** that abstract the transport layer:
- **Local**: Direct function calls within the same process
- **gRPC**: High-performance remote procedure calls
- **HTTP/REST**: Standard web APIs

The `ClientHub` provides type-safe client resolution, allowing modules to communicate without knowing the underlying transport.

---

---

## 5. Code Organization

### 5.1. Monorepo Structure

HyperSpot uses a **monorepo** approach with multiple crates:

```
hyperspot/
├── apps/              # Executable applications (hyperspot-server)
├── config/            # Configuration files
├── docs/              # Architecture and development guides
├── dylint_lints/      # Project-specific lints (see `make dylint`)
├── examples/          # Example modules and usage patterns
├── guidelines/        # Coding standards and best practices for LLMs
├── libs/              # Shared libraries (modkit, modkit-db, modkit-auth, etc.)
├── modules/           # Business logic modules
│   ├── system/        # Core system modules (api-gateway, grpc-hub, module-orchestrator, nodes-registry, types-registry)
│   └── ...            # User modules (file-parser, etc.)
├── scripts/           # Custom scripts for build, testing, etc.
└── testing/           # E2E and integration tests (pytest)
```

### 5.2. External Integration

 The 'main' crates can be located in separate repositories and use HyperSpot modules as dependencies via Cargo. This allows:
 - Custom applications built on HyperSpot by choosing only needed modules
 - Private modules not in the main repo
 - Vendor-specific extensions (modules, plugins, adapters)

### 5.3. Module Layout (DDD-Light)

 Every module follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD-light)** structure:

```
modules/<module-dir>/
├── <module-name>-sdk/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       ├── lib.rs                    # Re-exports
│       ├── api.rs                    # ClientHub API trait (methods take &SecurityContext)
│       ├── models.rs                 # Transport-agnostic models (no serde)
│       ├── error.rs|errors.rs         # Transport-agnostic errors
│       ├── (optional) proto/         # Generated gRPC/proto types for OoP modules
│       └── (optional) wiring.rs      # gRPC client wiring/helpers for OoP transport
└── <module-name>/
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src/
        ├── lib.rs                        # Public exports
        ├── module.rs                     # Module struct + #[modkit::module(...)]
        ├── config.rs                     # Typed module config
        ├── api/
        │   └── rest/
        │       ├── dto.rs                # REST-only DTOs (serde + ToSchema)
        │       ├── handlers.rs           # Thin HTTP handlers
        │       ├── routes.rs             # Route + OpenAPI registration (OperationBuilder)
        │       ├── error.rs              # DomainError -> Problem mapping
        │       └── mappers.rs            # DTO <-> domain mapping
        ├── domain/                       # Business logic
        │   └── local_client.rs           # Local adapter implementing an SDK API trait (optional)
        ├── infra/                        # Infrastructure adapters (optional)
        ├── tests/                        # Optional
        └── (optional extras: gts/, openspec/, build.rs, etc.)
```

Additional common patterns (see `examples/`):

- **Module + plugins pattern** (pluggable workers via `ClientHub` scopes):
  - Module crate: `<module>/`
  - SDK crate: `<module>-sdk/`
  - Plugin crates: `plugins/<vendor>_<plugin>/`

- **Out-of-process (OoP) module pattern** (gRPC boundary):
  - SDK crate with gRPC client + wiring helpers
  - Module crate with gRPC server + (optional) `main.rs` binary for OoP execution

 **Layer responsibilities:**
 - **SDK (optional but recommended)**: The stable public surface for other modules/apps.
   - Transport-agnostic traits, models, and errors.
   - No `serde`, no `axum`, no `utoipa`, no HTTP types.
 - **Module bootstrap** (`module.rs` + `#[modkit::module]`): Lifecycle, configuration loading, wiring adapters, and `ClientHub` registrations.
 - **API (transport adapters)**: REST/gRPC adapters.
   - REST DTOs are defined only in `api/rest` and must not leak into domain/SDK.
 - **Domain**: Core business logic and invariants.
   - Depends on ports/repo traits, not on concrete DB/HTTP.
 - **Infra**: Concrete implementations of storage and integrations.
   - DB repositories, HTTP clients, SDK clients, filesystems, etc.

### 5.4. ModKit - The Foundation

Every HyperSpot module uses the **ModKit** framework, which provides:
- **Module lifecycle**: Initialization, configuration, shutdown
- **REST API builder**: Type-safe route registration with OpenAPI
- **Database access**: SeaORM and SQLx integration
- **Client hub**: Type-safe inter-module communication
- **Error handling**: RFC-9457 Problem Details for HTTP APIs
- **Observability**: Structured logging and distributed tracing
- **SSE support**: Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

 **Key ModKit libraries:**
 - `modkit` - Core module framework: lifecycle, REST host/contracts, OpenAPI registry, ClientHub, tracing helpers
 - `modkit-macros` - Procedural macros for module registration (`#[modkit::module(...)]`) and domain model enforcement (`#[domain_model]`)
 - `modkit-auth` - Authentication and authorization: inbound JWT/OIDC validation with route policies, outbound OAuth2 client credentials with automatic token refresh and `Authorization: Bearer` injection ([ADR](adrs/modkit/0002-modkit-auth-client-with-aliri.md))
 - `modkit-macros` - Procedural macros for module registration (`#[modkit::module(...)]`)
 - `modkit-http` - First-party HTTP client (`hyper + tower`): TLS, retries, timeouts, concurrency limiting, decompression, OTel tracing, and extensible auth layer hook ([ADR](adrs/modkit/0001-modkit-hyper-tower-http-client.md))
 - `modkit-security` - `SecurityContext` and security-scoping primitives used across modules (request-scoped context)
 - `modkit-errors` - Shared error types and RFC-9457 Problem modeling utilities
 - `modkit-errors-macro` - Macros/codegen for error catalogs
 - `modkit-db` - Database runtime integration (DbHandle/DbManager) + Secure ORM patterns
 - `modkit-db-macros` - DB macros (e.g., secure ORM helpers, OData derives)
 - `modkit-odata` - OData query + pagination primitives
 - `modkit-transport-grpc` - gRPC client/server transport utilities (timeouts/retries/tracing)
 - `modkit-node-info` - Node/runtime metadata used for deployments and diagnostics

## 6. Dependencies and Standards

### 6.1. DNA - Development Guidelines

[DNA](https://github.com/cyberfabric/DNA) is HyperSpot's collection of development standards and best practices:
- **REST API design**: Status codes, pagination, error handling

**Key guidelines:**
- `guidelines/DNA/REST/API.md` - REST API design principles

### 6.2. Extension Points (Type System)

HyperSpot uses the [Global Type System](https://github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-rust) ([specification](https://github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-spec)) to implement a powerful **extension point architecture** where virtually everything in the system can be extended without modifying core code.

**Core Concept: Extension Points**

An **extension point** is a well-defined interface where new functionality and data types can be plugged in dynamically. GTS enables this through:
- **Versioned type definitions**: Shared schemas across modules with backward compatibility
- **Type registration**: Runtime discovery of new types and implementations
- **Protocol buffer schemas**: Language-agnostic type definitions
- **Type evolution**: Safe schema changes without breaking existing code

**What Can Be Extended:**

1. **Module Plugins metadata** - Add new implementations behind entrypoint host modules:
   - **LLM Service Connectors**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, VLLM, LM Studio, custom providers
   - **LLM Benchmarks**: HumanEval, MBPP, custom evaluation frameworks
   - **Search Engines**: Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, Elasticsearch, custom engines
   - **File Parsers**: Embedded parser, Apache Tika, custom parsers
   - **Authentication Providers**: OAuth2, SAML, LDAP, custom auth systems

2. **Data Types in APIs** - Extend existing endpoints with new data structures:
   - **Event Types**: New domain events for the event manager
   - **Benchmark Result Formats**: Custom metrics and evaluation outputs
   - **Document Types**: New file formats and metadata schemas
   - **Message Formats**: Chat message types, attachments, rich content

3. **Executable Extensions**:
   - **FaaS Functions**: User-defined serverless functions
   - **Server-Side Workflows**: Custom workflows and automation
   - **Agents**: Pluggable AI agent implementations

**Benefits:**

- **High customization**: HyperSpot modules can be used as building blocks for custom AI applications or platforms
- **No Core Modifications**: Add new functionality without changing HyperSpot core
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checks for extension implementations
- **Version Compatibility**: Graceful handling of schema evolution
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Extensions are discovered at runtime via type registry
- **Third-Party Extensions**: External developers can create plugins and connectors

**Example Use Cases:**

- A vendor adds a proprietary chat extension for it's competitive solution
- A researcher implements a new MCP or benchmark suite as a module worker
- A user creates custom FaaS functions or workflows for domain-specific workflows
- An enterprise integrates a custom search engine for compliance requirements

This extension point architecture makes HyperSpot truly modular and adaptable to diverse use cases while maintaining type safety and system integrity.

# 6.3. Rust dependencies

All dependencies are specified in the root `Cargo.toml` file and are shared across all modules. This ensures consistency and ease of dependency management. Each member of the workspace will inherit the dependencies from the root `Cargo.toml` file and specify the features it needs.

That follows what's specified in [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-dependencies-section).

`[dev-dependencies]` section is used for dependencies that are only required for development and testing.

`[build-dependencies]` section is used for dependencies that are required for building the member.
