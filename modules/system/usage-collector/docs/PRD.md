## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

A usage metering module for collecting usage records from platform services and providing aggregated usage data to clients. The Usage Collector is the centralized store and query engine for all platform usage data. It receives usage records from sources, persists them durably in a pluggable storage backend, and serves aggregated results to downstream consumers.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

Platform services need a centralized place to report resource consumption (API calls, AI tokens, storage bytes, compute hours) so that downstream systems (billing, quota enforcement, dashboards) can operate on consistent data. Without a central usage module, each consumer implements its own collection logic, leading to inconsistent data, duplicated effort, and no single source of truth.

The Usage Collector addresses this by accepting usage records from sources and providing a query/aggregation API to consumers. Business logic (pricing, billing rules, invoice generation, quota enforcement decisions) remains the responsibility of downstream consumers.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- **Centralized metering**: All platform services that measure resource consumption report to a single authoritative store, eliminating per-service tracking implementations and data inconsistencies across the platform.
- **Zero record loss**: Every usage record successfully emitted by a source is eventually persisted and queryable — no record is silently lost due to source restarts, process failures, or transient storage unavailability.
- **Operator self-service for new resource types**: Platform operators can onboard new billable resource types (e.g., GPU hours, custom credit units) via API without code changes or service redeployment, supporting rapid product iteration.
- **Downstream consumers need no aggregation layer**: Billing, quota enforcement, and dashboard systems obtain aggregated usage views directly from the Usage Collector within interactive latency bounds, without maintaining their own aggregation infrastructure.

**Success Metrics** (measured at initial production release):

| Goal | Measurable Success Criterion | Target |
|------|------------------------------|--------|
| Centralized metering | All existing platform services with billable operations integrated with Usage Collector SDK; zero per-service custom metering implementations remaining | 100% of billable services at first production deployment |
| Zero record loss | Zero records silently discarded in soak testing over a 7-day period including storage backend failure injection; all failures surfaced via `outbox_dead_rows_total` monitoring | 0 silent losses over 7-day soak test |
| Operator self-service | Time to onboard a new billable resource type (from API call to first emittable records) without code changes or redeployment | ≤ 5 minutes end-to-end |
| Downstream consumers need no aggregation layer | All registered downstream consumers (billing, quota, dashboards) serve their primary aggregation use cases via the Usage Collector query API; no downstream-maintained aggregation tables required at launch | 0 downstream aggregation tables at first production deployment |

### 1.4 Glossary

| Term                   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Usage Record           | A single data point representing resource consumption by a tenant, with a numeric value and a timestamp                                                                                                                                                            |
| Counter                | A delta metric representing a non-negative increment since the last report (e.g., API calls in this batch). The Usage Collector accumulates submitted deltas into a monotonically increasing persistent total.                                                     |
| Gauge                  | A point-in-time metric that can go up or down (e.g., current memory usage in bytes). Stored as-is without monotonicity constraints.                                                                                                                                |
| Idempotency Key        | A client-provided identifier ensuring at-least-once processing without duplicate records                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Usage Collector Plugin | A storage backend plugin for a specific database (ClickHouse, TimescaleDB)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Record Metadata        | An optional, extensible JSON object attached to a usage record, allowing usage sources to include context-specific properties (e.g., LLM model name, token type, geographic region) that are opaque to the Usage Collector and interpreted by downstream consumers |
| Measuring Unit         | A registered schema defining how a specific usage type is measured (e.g., "ai-credits", "vCPU-hours", "gpu-hours")                                                                                                                                                 |
| Backfill               | The process of bulk-inserting historical usage records to fill gaps caused by outages, pipeline failures, or corrections. Backfill is purely additive and does not modify existing records.                                                                        |
| Amendment              | A correction to previously recorded usage data, either by updating properties of an individual event or deprecating it                                                                                                                                             |
| Reconciliation         | The process of comparing usage data across pipeline stages or external sources to detect gaps and inconsistencies (performed by external systems; the Usage Collector exposes metadata to support this)                                                            |
| Rate Limit Window      | A configurable time interval over which a source's emission count is tracked for rate limiting purposes (e.g., per second, per minute)                                                                                                                             |
| Emission Quota         | The maximum number of usage records a source module is permitted to emit across all tenants within a single rate limit window, enforced at the source by the SDK. Per-tenant granularity is enforced separately at the gateway on ingest.                         |
| PDP                    | Policy Decision Point — the platform authorization service (`authz-resolver`) that evaluates access control policies and returns permit/deny decisions, optionally with query constraint filters that narrow the scope of permitted operations                     |
| SecurityContext        | A platform-provided, server-side structure that carries the authenticated caller's identity, including tenant ID and subject (user or service account) identity. Derived from the request authentication token; never accepted from request payloads               |

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Usage Ingestion

#### Usage Record Ingestion

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-ingestion`

The system **MUST** accept usage records from platform services. Each usage record represents a single measurement of resource consumption attributed to a tenant.

- **Rationale**: Centralizing usage ingestion ensures all downstream consumers operate on the same data.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

#### Idempotent Ingestion

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-idempotency`

The system **MUST** support client-provided idempotency keys. When an idempotency key is provided, duplicate submissions with the same key **MUST** be silently deduplicated (no error, no duplicate record). Counter records **MUST** include an idempotency key; the system **MUST** reject counter records submitted without one. When no idempotency key is provided for a gauge record, the record is accepted as-is without deduplication.

- **Rationale**: At-least-once delivery semantics can produce duplicate submissions; deduplication prevents incorrect aggregations. For counter metrics, a retry of a keyless delta delivery inflates the accumulated total without any means of detection or correction — requiring an idempotency key on every counter emission eliminates this data integrity risk at the source. Gauge metrics lack a meaningful cumulative total, so duplicate gauge readings introduce at most transient noise rather than a systematic data integrity failure.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

#### Per-Record Extensible Metadata

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-record-metadata`

The system **MUST** support an optional, extensible metadata field on each usage record, allowing usage sources to attach arbitrary key-value properties as a JSON object. The system **MUST** persist metadata as-is and return it in query results without interpretation. The system **MUST** enforce a configurable maximum size limit on the metadata field (default 8 KB per record) and **MUST** reject records exceeding the limit with an actionable error.

The system **MUST NOT** index, aggregate, or interpret metadata contents — metadata is opaque to the Usage Collector. Downstream consumers (billing, reporting, analytics) are responsible for extracting and processing metadata fields according to their own domain logic.

- **Rationale**: Different usage sources need to attach context-specific properties to usage records (e.g., LLM model name, token type, request category, geographic region) that enable downstream reporting and analytics. Storing metadata per-record at ingestion time avoids the need to correlate usage records with external context stores.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-developer`

### 5.2 Metric Semantics

#### Counter Metric Semantics

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-counter-semantics`

The system **MUST** enforce counter semantics: sources submit non-negative delta values representing consumption since their last report. The system **MUST** reject counter records with negative values. The system **MUST** accumulate submitted deltas into a persistent, monotonically increasing total per (tenant, metric) tuple.

- **Rationale**: Delta-based reporting decouples the source's internal state from the Usage Collector's persistent totals. Sources never report cumulative values, so process restarts and counter resets in the source are transparent — a restart simply results in the next emission starting from zero again, which is valid.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

#### Gauge Metric Semantics

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-gauge-semantics`

The system **MUST** support gauge metrics representing point-in-time values. Gauge records **MUST** be stored as-is without monotonicity constraints or delta accumulation.

- **Rationale**: Gauges represent instantaneous measurements (e.g., current active connections, memory usage in bytes) that naturally fluctuate and have no meaningful cumulative total.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

### 5.3 Delivery Guarantee

#### At-Least-Once Delivery

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-delivery-guarantee`

The system **MUST** guarantee at-least-once delivery of usage records from sources to the Usage Collector. Once a usage source has emitted a record via the SDK, that record **MUST** eventually reach the Usage Collector and be available for querying, even if the Usage Collector is temporarily unavailable at the time of emission. The system **MUST** surface permanently undeliverable records via operational monitoring.

- **Rationale**: Usage data is billing-critical; loss of emitted records is unacceptable.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

### 5.4 Attribution & Isolation

#### Tenant Attribution

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-attribution`

The system **MUST** attribute all usage records to a tenant that is authorized by the platform PDP at emit time. For sources that emit only for their own tenant, the tenant is derived from the authenticated SecurityContext. For sources explicitly authorized by the PDP to emit on behalf of multiple tenants (e.g., a platform-level metering agent collecting data from a shared hypervisor), the tenant is taken from the record as supplied by the caller and **MUST** satisfy the PDP-returned tenant constraint evaluated in-memory by `emit()` before the record is accepted. In all cases, tenant identity **MUST NOT** be accepted from request payloads without prior PDP authorization. The gateway **MUST** independently validate tenant attribution on ingest as a defense-in-depth check.

- **Rationale**: PDP-gated tenant attribution prevents spoofing while enabling platform-level metering agents that collect usage for resources (e.g., virtual machines) owned by multiple tenants from a single process. Without this capability, such agents would require per-tenant service account credentials, creating operational complexity proportional to tenant count. PDP authorization remains the single source of truth for what tenants any given source is permitted to report for.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

#### Resource Attribution

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-resource-attribution`

The system **MUST** support attributing usage records to specific resource instances within a tenant, identified by a resource ID and resource type.

- **Rationale**: Per-resource attribution enables granular billing, per-resource quota enforcement, and detailed usage analysis at the resource level.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

#### Subject Attribution

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-subject-attribution`

The system **MUST** support attributing usage records to a subject (user, service account, or other principal) within a tenant, identified by a subject ID and subject type. Subject attribution **MUST** always be derived from the authenticated SecurityContext — the system **MUST NOT** accept subject identity from request payloads.

Subject attribution is optional per usage record to accommodate system-level resource consumption not attributable to a specific subject (e.g., background jobs where per-user attribution is not meaningful).

- **Rationale**: Per-subject attribution enables chargeback, per-subject quota enforcement, and visibility into which principals drive consumption within a tenant. Deriving subject identity server-side from SecurityContext prevents spoofing.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`
- **Data Classification**: Subject IDs stored by the Usage Collector are opaque internal platform identifiers issued and managed by the platform identity layer (SecurityContext). They are not directly identifying natural persons within this module. PII management responsibilities belong to the platform identity layer; the Usage Collector stores and processes only these opaque identifiers. See §6.3 NFR Exclusions for the Privacy by Design applicability statement.

#### Tenant Isolation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-tenant-isolation`

The system **MUST** enforce strict tenant isolation on all read and write operations, ensuring usage data is never accessible across tenants. The system **MUST** fail closed on authorization failures.

- **Rationale**: Tenant data isolation is a security and compliance requirement.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`

#### Ingestion Authorization

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-ingestion-authorization`

The system **MUST** authorize each usage record emission before it is persisted. Authorization **MUST** verify that the emitting source module is permitted to report the specific metrics being submitted, and that any attributed resource and subject are within the emitting module's authorized scope.

Each source module has a fixed, platform-assigned identity that is the basis for authorization. A source module **MUST** only be permitted to emit metrics within its authorized domain; emissions outside that domain **MUST** be rejected before any record is persisted.

Authorization failures **MUST** be surfaced immediately to the caller before any domain operation is committed. The system **MUST** fail closed: unauthorized records are never persisted, and there is no silent discard of denied emissions.

- **Rationale**: Without ingestion authorization, any module could report usage for metric types it does not own (e.g., a file-storage service reporting LLM token usage) or attribute usage to subjects and resources beyond its authorized scope, leading to inaccurate metering, billing errors, and cross-boundary data pollution. Binding source identity at initialization time rather than per-call makes the authorization scope auditable and eliminates per-call spoofing surface.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

### 5.5 Pluggable Storage

#### Pluggable Storage Backend

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-pluggable-storage`

The system **MUST** support pluggable storage backends. Each plugin provides persistence and query capabilities for its specific backend (ClickHouse, TimescaleDB). The operator selects the active backend via configuration.

- **Rationale**: Pluggable storage avoids lock-in and allows operators to choose the backend that fits their needs.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-storage-backend`

### 5.6 Usage Query & Aggregation

#### Aggregated Usage Query

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-aggregation`

The system **MUST** provide an API for querying aggregated usage data. Queries **MUST** support:
- Filtering by tenant (mandatory, derived from SecurityContext), time range (mandatory), and optionally by usage type, subject (subject ID and subject type), resource (resource ID and resource type), and source
- Server-side aggregation functions: SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG
- Grouping by any combination of: time bucket (e.g., hourly, daily), usage type, subject, resource, and source

The system **MUST** authorize each query via the platform PDP. The PDP decision determines whether the caller is permitted to query usage data; PDP-returned constraints are applied as additional query filters before execution. The system **MUST** fail closed on authorization failures.

- **Rationale**: Downstream consumers (billing, dashboards) need aggregated views without fetching and processing raw records. Filter and grouping dimensions enable billing breakdowns (e.g., tokens per model per day) and per-subject chargeback without requiring consumers to process raw records.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`

#### Raw Usage Query

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-query-raw`

The system **MUST** provide an API for querying raw usage records with cursor-based pagination. Queries **MUST** support filtering by tenant (mandatory, derived from SecurityContext), time range (mandatory), and optionally by usage type, subject (subject ID and subject type), and resource (resource ID and resource type).

The system **MUST** authorize each query via the platform PDP using decision and constraint enforcement, identical to the aggregation query path.

- **Rationale**: Some consumers need access to individual records for auditing, debugging, or dispute resolution.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`

### 5.7 Retention Policy Management

#### Retention Policy Management

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-retention-policies`

The system **MUST** support configurable retention policies at three scopes: global (applies to all records), per-tenant, and per-usage-type. When multiple policies match a record, the most-specific scope wins: per-usage-type > per-tenant > global.

The system **MUST** enforce a global default retention policy. When no policy matches a record, the global default applies. The system **MUST** reject requests to delete the global default policy.

Retention enforcement **MUST** permanently delete expired records (hard delete). The `inactive` status is reserved for operator-initiated amendments and **MUST NOT** be used by retention enforcement.

- **Rationale**: Retention policies balance storage costs with compliance and operational needs. Different usage types may have different regulatory retention requirements. Explicit precedence rules and a mandatory global default ensure no record has undefined retention behavior.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

### 5.8 Backfill & Amendment

#### Backfill API

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-backfill-api`

The system **MUST** provide a backfill API that allows operators to bulk-insert historical usage records for a specific time range (scoped to a single tenant and usage type). Backfill is purely additive: existing records in the target range are not modified.

Real-time ingestion **MUST** continue uninterrupted during a backfill operation. Real-time events that arrive in the target range during or after the backfill are recorded normally and are not affected by the backfill. The backfill API **MUST** be isolated from the real-time ingestion path with independent rate limits and lower processing priority to prevent backfill operations from degrading real-time ingestion performance.

- **Rationale**: When usage data is lost due to outages, pipeline failures, or misconfigured sources, operators need a mechanism to retroactively submit the missing records. Keeping backfill and real-time ingestion independent avoids any interruption to ongoing usage reporting.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

#### Individual Event Amendment

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-event-amendment`

The system **MUST** support amending individual usage events (updating properties except tenant ID and timestamp) and deactivating individual events (marking them as inactive while retaining them for audit). Downstream consumers **MUST** be able to distinguish active from inactive records when querying.

- **Rationale**: Not all corrections require full timeframe backfill. Individual event amendments handle cases like incorrect resource attribution or value errors on specific events.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

#### Backfill Time Boundaries

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-backfill-boundaries`

The system **MUST** enforce configurable time boundaries for backfill operations: a maximum backfill window (default 90 days) beyond which backfill requests are rejected, and a future timestamp tolerance (default 5 minutes) to account for clock drift. Backfill requests exceeding the maximum window **MUST** require elevated authorization.

- **Rationale**: Unbounded backfill creates risks for data integrity and billing accuracy. Time boundaries constrain the blast radius of backfill operations while allowing legitimate corrections.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`


#### Metadata Exposure

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-metadata-exposure`

The system **MUST** expose per-source and per-tenant metadata — including event counts, latest event timestamps (watermarks), and ingestion statistics — via API, enabling external reconciliation and observability systems to detect gaps and perform integrity checks.

- **Rationale**: While reconciliation logic is out of scope for the Usage Collector, exposing the raw metadata needed for gap detection enables external systems to build reconciliation workflows.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-monitoring-system`

### 5.9 Usage Type System

#### Usage Type Validation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-type-validation`

The system **MUST** validate all usage records against their registered type schema before any record is accepted for delivery, rejecting invalid records immediately with actionable error messages.

- **Rationale**: Schema validation prevents corrupt or malformed data from entering the system, ensuring downstream consumers operate on well-structured data. Immediate rejection surfaces errors to the caller before any domain operation is committed.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-types-registry`

#### Custom Measuring Unit Registration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-custom-units`

The system **MUST** allow platform operators to register custom measuring units via API without code changes or service redeployment.

Primary use cases: AI/LLM token metering (input/output tokens, custom credit units), compute metering (vCPU-hours, GPU-hours), API request metering (calls by tenant and endpoint), storage metering (GB-hours across tiers), and network transfer (bytes ingress/egress).

When a custom measuring unit is registered, the platform operator **MUST** also configure the authorization policies that declare which sources are permitted to emit records of this type.

- **Rationale**: New resource types (AI tokens, GPU-hours) must be meterable without service redeployment. Custom unit registration enables rapid onboarding of new usage types as the platform evolves.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

### 5.10 Audit Events

#### Audit Event Emission

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-audit`

The system **MUST** emit a structured audit event to the platform `audit_service` for every operator-initiated write operation (backfill, amendment, deactivation). Each event **MUST** include the operator identity, tenant, timestamp, operation type, operation-specific context, and a mandatory operator-supplied justification. The Usage Collector **MUST NOT** store audit data locally — audit storage, retention, and deletion semantics are owned by `audit_service`.

Routine ingestion and read operations are not audited via `audit_service`.

- **Rationale**: Operator-initiated mutations are high-risk changes to billing-critical data. Emitting to the platform `audit_service` provides a consistent, centralized audit trail across all platform modules.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

### 5.11 Rate Limiting

#### Emission Rate Limiting

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-rate-limiting`

The system **MUST** enforce rate limits on usage record emission at two levels:

**Source-level (enforced at the SDK, before any outbox INSERT)**: A configurable per-source emission quota limits the total number of records a source module may emit across all tenants within a rate limit window. `authorize_emit()` fetches the current source-level quota snapshot before any DB transaction opens; `emit()` evaluates it in-memory and rejects the emission if the quota is exhausted. This provides low-latency, source-side flood prevention without requiring per-tenant quota pre-fetching at emit time.

**Per-tenant (enforced at the gateway on ingest)**: A configurable per-(source module, tenant) quota limits the number of records a source may deliver for any single tenant within a rate limit window. The gateway enforces this on the inbound `persist()` call, after the record's `tenant_id` is known. This provides granular per-tenant protection at delivery time.

Rate limits are configured by the platform operator. An operator **MAY** configure a default quota that applies when no explicit entry exists; if neither applies, no rate limit is enforced.

When a source exceeds its configured quota, the emission or delivery **MUST** be rejected with an actionable error. The system **MUST** surface rate-limit rejections via operational monitoring.

Rate limit enforcement **MUST NOT** degrade ingestion latency for emissions within quota.

Rate limit enforcement provides a best-effort flood prevention guarantee: individual emissions that observe an exhausted quota are rejected, but a small number of concurrent emissions may slip past the limit under high concurrency. This is acceptable for flood prevention; hard-counted accounting is the responsibility of downstream consumers.

- **Rationale**: A misbehaving or misconfigured source can flood the delivery queue or a single tenant's records, degrading ingestion for all sources and overwhelming downstream processing. Source-level limits with immediate SDK-side rejection protect the system without requiring pre-fetching of per-tenant quota state for sources that emit for many tenants. Gateway-side per-tenant limits provide granular protection once the target tenant is known.
- **Actors**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Module-Specific NFRs

#### Query Latency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-query-latency`

Aggregation queries over a 30-day range for a single tenant **MUST** complete within 500ms at p95.

- **Threshold**: 500ms p95 for 30-day single-tenant aggregation
- **Rationale**: Interactive dashboard and billing queries need timely responses.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md §3.7 Counter Accumulation. Meeting this threshold at production record volumes requires storage plugins to maintain pre-aggregated acceleration structures (e.g., ClickHouse `AggregatingMergeTree` view or TimescaleDB continuous aggregate). These structures are eventually consistent with the delta records table; the maximum refresh lag is an operational parameter documented per plugin.

#### High Availability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-availability`

The system **MUST** maintain 99.95% monthly availability for usage ingestion endpoints.

- **Threshold**: 99.95% uptime per calendar month
- **Rationale**: Usage collection is on the critical path for all billable operations.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Ingestion Throughput

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-throughput`

The system **MUST** sustain ingestion of at least 10,000 usage records per second under normal operation.

- **Threshold**: ≥ 10,000 records/sec sustained
- **Rationale**: High-volume services (LLM Gateway, API Gateway) generate significant event throughput; the ingestion path must not become a bottleneck.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Ingestion Latency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-ingestion-latency`

The system **MUST** complete usage record ingestion within 200ms at p95 under normal load.

- **Threshold**: p95 ≤ 200ms
- **Rationale**: Low ingestion latency prevents blocking in usage source services.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Workload Isolation

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-workload-isolation`

The system **MUST** ensure that retention enforcement jobs and aggregation query workloads do not degrade ingestion latency. These workloads **MUST** be isolated from the ingestion path such that concurrent execution maintains ingestion p95 latency within the `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-ingestion-latency` threshold.

- **Threshold**: Ingestion p95 latency remains ≤ 200ms during concurrent query and retention operations
- **Rationale**: Retention and aggregation are batch or analytical workloads that can compete for storage resources with the latency-sensitive ingestion path.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Authentication Required

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-authentication`

The system **MUST** require authentication for all API operations. Unauthenticated requests **MUST** be rejected before any operation is performed.

- **Threshold**: Zero unauthenticated API access
- **Rationale**: Usage data is billing-sensitive; unauthenticated access is a security violation.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Authorization Enforcement

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-authorization`

The system **MUST** enforce authorization for all read and write operations based on the caller's authenticated identity, tenant context, and usage type permissions.

- **Threshold**: Zero unauthorized data access or write
- **Rationale**: Authorization prevents unauthorized usage data manipulation and cross-tenant data leakage.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Horizontal Scalability

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-scalability`

The system **MUST** scale horizontally to handle increased ingestion and query load without architectural changes.

- **Threshold**: Linear throughput scaling with added instances
- **Rationale**: Usage volume grows with platform adoption; vertical scaling is insufficient for sustained growth.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Storage Fault Tolerance

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-fault-tolerance`

Once a usage record has been durably captured by the delivery mechanism, the system **MUST** ensure it is eventually persisted to the storage backend and available for querying, even under storage backend failures. The system **MUST** buffer and retry persistence operations during storage outages without data loss.

- **Threshold**: Zero data loss for durably captured records during storage backend failures
- **Rationale**: Storage outages must not result in lost usage data for records already accepted by the delivery mechanism.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Recovery Time

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-recovery`

The system **MUST** resume normal ingestion and make all durably captured records available for querying within 15 minutes of storage backend recovery.

- **Threshold**: RTO ≤ 15 minutes from storage backend recovery
- **Rationale**: Bounded recovery time ensures downstream billing and quota systems are not blocked for extended periods after a storage outage.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Recovery Point Objective

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-rpo`

The system **MUST** guarantee zero data loss for all usage records that have been durably accepted by the SDK (`emit()` returned `Ok`). A record is durable once it is committed to the source's local outbox within the caller's database transaction. No committed record may be lost due to storage backend failures, gateway restarts, or dispatcher crashes.

- **Threshold**: RPO = 0 for committed records (zero committed data loss)
- **Rationale**: Usage records are billing-critical; any committed record that is silently lost represents an unrecoverable billing gap. The transactional outbox ensures that a record either commits to the source's local DB (and will eventually be delivered) or is never considered accepted.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Configurable Retention Range

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-retention`

The system **MUST** support retention periods from 7 days to 7 years, selectable per usage type and per tenant.

- **Threshold**: Configurable retention from 7 days to 7 years
- **Rationale**: Different usage types have different compliance and operational retention requirements; a fixed retention period is insufficient.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

#### Graceful Degradation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-nfr-graceful-degradation`

The system **MUST** continue accepting and persisting usage records even if downstream consumers (billing, monitoring) are unavailable.

- **Threshold**: Zero ingestion failures due to downstream consumer unavailability
- **Rationale**: Usage collection must not be blocked by consumer outages; the collector is the source of truth and must remain operational independently.
- **Architecture Allocation**: See DESIGN.md

### 6.2 Data Governance

**Data Steward**: Platform Engineering team owns the usage data schema, ingestion policies, and retention rules for the Usage Collector. The data steward is responsible for maintaining usage type definitions, authorizing metric namespaces per source module, and setting global retention policy.

**Data Classification**: Usage records contain numeric measurements, metric names, timestamps, and tenant-scoped opaque identifiers (tenant ID, subject ID, resource ID). No natural-person PII is stored directly. Records are classified as **Platform Operational Data** — internal, business-sensitive, restricted to authenticated platform actors.

**Data Ownership**:

| Data | Owner | Custodian |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Usage records (metric values, timestamps) | The tenant identified by `tenant_id` in each record | Usage Collector module (storage) |
| Retention policy configuration | Platform Operator | Usage Collector module (enforcer) |
| Usage type schemas and measuring unit definitions | Platform Engineering | types-registry module |
| Audit events for operator-initiated writes | Platform Engineering | audit_service module |
| Outbox rows (pre-delivery records) | Source module (until delivered) | modkit-db infrastructure |

**Retention**: Governed by configurable retention policies (global, per-tenant, per-usage-type) as defined in `cpt-cf-usage-collector-fr-retention-policies`. The global default policy MUST be set by the platform operator at deployment time; it cannot be deleted.

**Deletion**: Retention enforcement performs hard deletes — records are permanently removed from the storage backend when their retention period expires. The deletion is not reversible. Operator-initiated deactivation sets `status = inactive` but retains the record; permanent deletion is only via retention enforcement.

### 6.3 NFR Exclusions

The following commonly applicable NFR categories are not applicable to this module:

- **Safety (ISO/IEC 25010:2023 §4.2.9)**: Not applicable — the Usage Collector is a server-side data API with no physical interaction, no safety-critical operations, and no ability to cause harm to people, property, or the environment.
- **Accessibility and Usability (UX)**: Not applicable — the Usage Collector exposes no user-facing UI. It provides a developer SDK and a server-side API consumed exclusively by platform services and internal systems.
- **Internationalization / Localization**: Not applicable — the module exposes no user-facing text, labels, or locale-sensitive output.
- **Privacy by Design (GDPR Art. 25)**: Not applicable as a standalone module requirement. Subject IDs stored by the Usage Collector are opaque internal platform identifiers; PII management is the responsibility of the platform identity layer. See note in §5.4 (Subject Attribution).
- **Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX)**: Not applicable as a standalone module requirement — this is an internal platform infrastructure module. This module handles no payment card data (PCI DSS N/A), no healthcare records (HIPAA N/A), and no financial reporting data (SOX N/A). Platform-level regulatory obligations are governed at the platform level.

- **Stability**: unstable (v0)
- **Description**: Public interface for emitting usage records and querying aggregated data; technical interface type and crate naming defined in DESIGN.md
- **Breaking Change Policy**: Unstable during initial development; will stabilize in future version

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

#### Storage Plugin Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-contract-storage-plugin`

## 8. Use Cases

#### Emit Usage Records

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-usecase-emit`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-source`

**Preconditions**:
- Actor is authenticated with a valid SecurityContext containing tenant identity
- A scoped SDK client has been initialized with the source module's identity
- Authorization policies are configured declaring which usage types the source module is permitted to emit

**Main Flow**:
1. Usage source initializes a scoped SDK client, providing its module identity as the emission scope
2. Usage source emits usage records via the scoped client
3. The system checks the emission: verifies the source module is authorized to report the target usage types and that any attributed resource and subject fall within its authorized scope; validates the record against the registered usage type schema; and checks the emission count against the configured rate limit for the (source module, tenant) pair. Any failure is returned immediately to the caller before any record is accepted for delivery.
4. Records are durably captured with at-least-once delivery guarantee
5. Records become available for querying in the Usage Collector

**Postconditions**:
- Authorized, valid, within-quota records are persisted in the storage backend and available for aggregation queries
- Duplicate records (by idempotency key) are silently ignored

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Authorization denied**: System returns an error immediately; no record is accepted for delivery
- **Schema invalid**: System returns an actionable error immediately; no record is accepted for delivery
- **Rate limit exceeded**: System returns an actionable error immediately; no record is accepted for delivery

#### Query Aggregated Usage

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-usecase-query-aggregated`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-usage-consumer`, `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Actor is authenticated with a valid SecurityContext

**Main Flow**:
1. Consumer sends an aggregation query specifying time range, aggregation function, and grouping
2. System derives tenant ID from SecurityContext
3. System returns aggregated results scoped to the tenant

**Postconditions**:
- Consumer receives aggregated usage data scoped to their tenant

**Alternative Flows**:
- **No data in range**: System returns empty result set (not an error)

#### Register Custom Usage Type

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-usecase-configure-unit`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-usage-collector-actor-platform-operator`

**Preconditions**:
- Actor is authenticated with a valid SecurityContext with operator-level permissions
- The usage type name is unique in the Types Registry

**Main Flow**:
1. Operator defines the usage type: a unique name, the metric kind (`counter` or `gauge`), and a unit label (e.g. `bytes`, `requests`, `vCPU-hours`)
2. Operator submits the definition via the API
3. System validates the definition against schema constraints
4. System registers the usage type with the Types Registry
5. Operator configures authorization policies declaring which source modules are permitted to emit records of this type
6. System confirms successful registration

**Postconditions**:
- The new usage type is immediately available for ingestion; sources can emit records using its name
- Authorization policies are in effect; unauthorized sources are rejected when attempting to emit records of this type

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Duplicate name**: System rejects registration with an actionable error; no type is created
- **Invalid definition**: System returns a validation error; no type is created

## 11. Assumptions

| Assumption | Owner | Validation |
|------------|-------|------------|
| The modkit-db durable event persistence infrastructure is available as shared infrastructure | Platform Infrastructure | Verified at module bootstrapping; usage-collector module fails to start if modkit-db outbox table is not present |

## 12. Risks

| Risk                                                              | Impact                          | Mitigation                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Raw `SUM` over high-cardinality counter records exceeds 500ms p95 query latency | Slow dashboard/billing queries  | Plugins SHOULD maintain pre-aggregated acceleration structures (DESIGN.md §3.7); eventual consistency with bounded refresh lag is the expected model; plugins that omit pre-aggregation must benchmark and confirm the NFR is met without it |
| Permanently failed deliveries accumulate without operator attention | Data gaps in storage backend    | Operational monitoring and alerting on failed delivery count      |
| Optimistic rate limit enforcement allows a small burst above quota under high concurrency | Momentary outbox overfill | Acceptable for flood prevention; burst magnitude bounded by concurrent emission degree; monitoring surfaces sustained limit violations |
