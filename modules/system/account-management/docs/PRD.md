> **Abbreviations**: Account Management = **AM**; Global Type System = **GTS**. Used throughout this document.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

AM is the foundational multi-tenancy source-of-truth module for the Cyber Fabric platform. It provides hierarchical tenant management, tenant isolation metadata, delegated administration, and a pluggable Identity Provider (IdP) integration contract for administrative user lifecycle operations.

AM enables diverse organizational models — from cloud hosting (Provider / Reseller / Customer) to enterprise divisions and managed-service providers — within a single deployment, supporting both managed (delegated administration) and self-managed (barrier-isolated) tenant modes in the same hierarchy.

Here, a deployment means one installed/running Cyber Fabric environment with a single AM root tenant and one configured tenant-type topology. Different organizational shapes are modeled as tenant hierarchies inside that deployment, not as separate platform installations.

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

Cyber Fabric needs a unified multi-tenancy model that supports diverse organizational structures and business models within a single deployment. Without a shared tenant hierarchy, each organizational model requires separate infrastructure or custom integration, increasing operational cost and limiting platform scalability.

Tenant hierarchy is needed because many customers operate as parent/child organizations rather than flat accounts. It lets the platform model delegated administration, governance boundaries, inherited defaults, and future billing/reporting flows in a way that matches real customer structure.

The platform needs a tenant model with unlimited hierarchy depth (configurable advisory threshold), visibility barriers for self-managed tenants, and consistent tenant context propagation across all services.

**Representative use-cases the module is designed for:**

| Domain | Use-case | How AM is used |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Cloud hosting** | Model a service-provider channel: *Provider → Reseller → Customer*. Provider onboards resellers who sell to end-customers. | Each level is a GTS-registered tenant type; individual organizations are tenant entities forming a tree. Provider manages resellers and customers through a single hierarchy view. |
| **Education** | Model a university consortium: *Consortium → University → College*. Consortium provides shared infrastructure; each university operates independently. | Consortium is root tenant; universities are child tenants with their own billing, security policy, and data isolation. A college (e.g., School of Medicine) may be self-managed to enforce stricter data-access rules than the parent university. |
| **Enterprise** | Model a corporation with divisions: *HQ → Region → Business Unit*. Each unit manages its own users and resources while HQ retains oversight. | HQ is root tenant; regions and business units are child tenants. `BarrierMode` controls whether HQ can traverse into a self-managed unit; a self-managed unit's metadata is independent (no inheritance from HQ). |
| **MSP / Managed Services** | A managed service provider operates customer environments on their behalf. | Parent-child managed relationship (no barrier). Parent remains eligible for delegated administration of child environments subject to platform authorization policy; the exact v1 access mechanism is an open question. |
| **Distributor / Reseller** | A distributor resells platform capacity but does not access customer data. | Self-managed child tenants create visibility barriers. Distributor sees billing metadata (`BarrierMode::Ignore`) but cannot access customer APIs or resources. |

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- Reduce tenant onboarding to one AM tenant-create call plus provider-executed provisioning, replacing the current multi-step hierarchy and IdP setup workflow with one stable contract for tenant hierarchy, type enforcement, barrier semantics, and user group coordination (via [Resource Group](../../resource-group/docs/PRD.md)).
- Run both managed (no barrier — delegated administration) and self-managed (with barrier — independent operation) tenant modes inside the same deployed tenant tree, eliminating the need for separate per-model deployment variants across MSP, reseller, and enterprise topologies.
- Support hierarchies beyond the default advisory threshold of 10 levels in the AM data model while keeping the default behavior warning-only, preserving a configurable strict rejection mode, and grounding production support in benchmark-backed deployment-profile limits.
- Hold end-to-end tenant-context validation to p95 ≤ 5ms on the approved deployment profile.
- Pass the full AM cross-tenant isolation test suite with zero observed data leaks.
- Prove the pluggable IdP integration contract against at least two conforming provider implementations for tenant and user lifecycle operations.

**Success criteria:**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Tenant onboarding effort | 5+ API calls and manual IdP configuration per tenant | Single API call — tenant create with type and mode | Module GA |
| Separate deployments per tenant model | 2 separate deployment configurations required today (one per managed/self-managed pattern) | Both modes in one tenant tree — zero per-model deployments (pass/fail) | Module GA |
| End-to-end tenant context validation latency (p95) | 0 approved AM-backed benchmarks against the target | ≥ 1 approved pre-GA benchmark on the deployment profile with p95 ≤ 5ms through the resolver path | Pre-GA load test gate |
| Cross-tenant data leaks | 0 AM-specific automated isolation scenarios wired into the gate today | Zero leaks observed; 100% of the planned AM isolation scenarios pass | Pre-GA security gate |
| Hierarchy depth coverage | Fixed shallow hierarchies (2–3 levels) | No hard AM structural depth cap; configurable advisory threshold (default: 10); benchmark-backed validation of at least 3 distinct type topologies including hierarchies beyond the default threshold on the approved deployment profile | Pre-GA performance + integration gate |
| Conforming IdP provider implementations | 0 provider implementations validated against the AM contract suite | ≥ 2 provider implementations pass the AM tenant/user lifecycle contract suite without breaking the public API contract | Pre-GA integration gate |

### 1.4 Non-goals

- User authentication flows (covered by IAM PRD).
- Authorization policy evaluation or SQL predicate generation (covered by AuthZ Resolver).
- Resource provisioning and lifecycle for non-identity platform resources. AM owns tenant hierarchy and tenant-scoped administrative metadata, not downstream resource CRUD or provisioning workflows.
- Being an IdP implementation — AM consumes IdP, not replaces it.
- User-tenant reassignment (moving a user between tenants) — deferred from v1; requires cross-platform coordination (Resource Group membership migration, resource ownership transfer, AuthZ cache invalidation, session revocation).
- Hierarchy reparenting (moving a tenant subtree to a new parent) — deferred from v1; requires explicit subtree-move semantics, pending conversion-request handling, depth recomputation for the full subtree, and restrictions on moves that would cross effective IdP provisioning boundaries.
- Partial metadata updates (HTTP `PATCH`) — v1 tenant metadata uses `PUT` full-replace semantics; field-level merge/patch is deferred and will be revisited once client workloads show need.
- Metadata change events / CloudEvents — no push notifications on metadata mutations in v1; deferred alongside the broader tenant lifecycle events until the Events and Audit Bus (EVT) is introduced. Consumers poll resolution APIs in the meantime.
- Secret storage via tenant metadata — AM metadata is **not** a secrets store. API keys, SSO client secrets, webhook signing keys, and any value requiring encryption-at-rest, per-access audit, or key rotation **MUST** use the platform secret manager; tenant metadata may hold only opaque references (IDs, URIs) to secrets stored elsewhere.

### 1.5 Glossary

> Platform-wide terms (Tenant, Subject Tenant, Context Tenant, Resource Tenant) are defined canonically in the [Authorization Core Terms](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md#core-terms) and the [Tenant Model](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/TENANT_MODEL.md). This glossary re-states them briefly for self-containedness and adds AM-specific terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| GTS (Global Type System) | Platform registry for runtime-extensible type definitions, validation rules, and schema-based constraints. AM uses GTS to register and validate tenant types and metadata schemas. |
| Tenant | Logical organizational entity representing a company, division, team, or individual. The fundamental unit of multi-tenancy isolation. |
| Subject Tenant | Tenant the subject (user or API client) belongs to. Used for authorization context. |
| Context Tenant | Tenant scope root for an operation. May differ from Subject Tenant in platform-authorized cross-tenant administrative scenarios. |
| Resource Tenant | Actual tenant owning a specific resource. |
| Self-Managed Tenant | Child tenant that creates a visibility barrier. The parent cannot see or access resources below this tenant through normal hierarchy and resource APIs. The only v1 exception is the dedicated conversion-request discovery surface (`/child-conversions`), which exposes minimal request metadata required for the dual-consent workflow. |
| Managed Tenant | Child tenant where the parent is eligible for controlled access to child tenant APIs and resources per policy. No visibility barrier exists. |
| Tenant Barrier | Visibility and access boundary created by self-managed tenants. When a tenant is self-managed, it blocks ancestor visibility into the subtree below it except for the narrow v1 conversion-request metadata carve-out described for `/child-conversions`. |
| Barrier Mode | Authorization parameter controlling barrier handling: `Respect` (default) stops traversal at self-managed boundaries; `Ignore` traverses through barriers for operations like billing queries. Values align with the `BarrierMode` SDK enum. Tenant metadata resolution does not use `BarrierMode::Ignore` — inheritance stops at self-managed boundaries instead (see §5.7). |
| Tenant Tree | Single rooted hierarchy of tenants. Has exactly one root tenant (`parent_id = NULL`) created at platform bootstrap. |
| Root Tenant | Top-level tenant in the tree (`parent_id = NULL`). Exactly one root tenant exists per deployment, created automatically during platform bootstrap. |
| Tenant Context | Tenant scope carried in the authorization request's `tenant_context` (separate from `SecurityContext`) to enforce isolation and scoping. |
| Tenant Status | Lifecycle state of a tenant: `active`, `suspended`, or `deleted`. |
| Conversion Request | A durable record representing a pending or resolved request to toggle a tenant's `self_managed` flag. Owns its own identifier, status lifecycle, approval window, and audit trail; addressable via the collection-based mode conversion REST API. |
| Conversion Request Status | Lifecycle state of a mode conversion request: `pending` (awaiting counterparty decision), `approved` (counterparty consented, conversion applied), `cancelled` (**initiator withdrew** the request from their own scope), `rejected` (**counterparty declined** the request from their own scope), or `expired` (configured approval window elapsed without resolution). `cancelled` and `rejected` are distinct terminal states — the distinction is carried in the status itself, not only in audit. |
| Tenant Type | Classification of a tenant node. Types are extensible at runtime via the GTS types registry. Deployments define their own type topology. |
| User | A human subject managed by AM via the IdP contract (provisioning, tenant binding, group membership). Corresponds to the platform-level [Subject](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md#core-terms) term narrowed to human identities; API clients and service accounts are not AM-managed users. |
| IdP Contract | Abstract pluggable interface for Identity Provider operations (tenant provisioning, tenant deprovisioning, user provisioning, deprovisioning, and tenant-scoped user query). |
| User Group | A [Resource Group](../../resource-group/docs/PRD.md) entity with a Resource Group type configured for user membership (`allowed_memberships` includes the user resource type). AM delegates group hierarchy, membership management, and cycle detection to the Resource Group module. |
| Tenant Metadata Schema | A GTS-registered schema that defines a category of extensible tenant data (e.g., branding, contacts), its validation rules, and its `inheritance_policy` trait; identified by its chained `schema_id`. |
| Inheritance Policy | The `inheritance_policy` trait on a tenant metadata schema, controlling parent-to-child propagation: `override_only` (default; each tenant sets its own value, no inheritance) or `inherit` (child inherits parent value unless overridden). |

## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### Platform Administrator

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

- **Role**: Operator of the platform with full access to the tenant tree, platform configuration, and bootstrap operations.
- **Needs**: View and manage the full tenant tree, perform platform bootstrap, override barriers for billing and administrative operations, monitor tenant health and isolation integrity.

#### Tenant Administrator

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

- **Role**: Administrator of a specific tenant who manages sub-tenants, users, groups, extensible tenant metadata, and tenant configuration within their scope.
- **Needs**: Create and manage child tenants, configure tenant metadata (branding, contacts, etc.) via GTS-registered schemas, manage user groups and memberships (via Resource Group), and control tenant mode (managed/self-managed).

### 2.2 System Actors

#### Tenant Resolver Plugin

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-resolver`

- **Role**: Maintains a denormalized projection of the tenant hierarchy for efficient subtree queries on the authorization hot path. Periodically synchronizes with the Account Service source of truth.

#### AuthZ Resolver Plugin

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-authz-resolver`

- **Role**: Evaluates authorization decisions using tenant context, barrier semantics, and subtree scoping constraints. Consumes the tenant hierarchy projection via [Tenant Resolver](../../tenant-resolver) for query-level tenant isolation.

#### IdP Provider

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

- **Role**: Pluggable identity provider that manages user authentication, token issuance, and user-tenant binding. Provides tenant identity via user attributes in tokens. Conforms to the AM IdP contract for user lifecycle operations.

#### Billing System

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-billing`

- **Role**: Consumes tenant hierarchy metadata with barrier bypass (`BarrierMode::Ignore`) for billing aggregation and reporting across the tenant tree.

#### GTS Registry

**ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-gts-registry`

- **Role**: Provides runtime-extensible type definitions for tenant types, enabling new tenant classifications without code changes. Validates parent-child type constraints at tenant creation time.

**Downstream consumer resilience**: Billing System and AuthZ Resolver Plugin are downstream consumers of AM data. Their resilience to AM unavailability is their own concern, consistent with the Tenant Resolver pattern where projection staleness is a Tenant Resolver responsibility.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

AM is the control-plane source of truth for tenant hierarchy, tenant mode, tenant metadata, and delegated user lifecycle intent. It is an administrative module, not a request-path enforcement module. Authentication, authorization, token handling, and tenant-scoped runtime enforcement are inherited from the platform AuthN/AuthZ architecture in [docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md).

### 3.1 Core Boundary

AM:

- owns the tenant hierarchy and tenant metadata (source of truth).
- validates structural invariants such as type compatibility, single-root topology, root immutability, and barrier-mode transitions.
- exposes authoritative tenant data consumed by Tenant Resolver, AuthZ Resolver, Billing System, and other platform components.
- coordinates tenant and user lifecycle operations against the configured IdP provider.

AM does not:

- evaluate authorization decisions or emit query predicates.
- validate bearer tokens, manage sessions, or construct `SecurityContext`.
- own user credentials, user profiles, or user-group storage.
- provision non-identity resources outside its own tenant and metadata domain.

### 3.2 IdP Integration Boundary

AM consumes a pluggable outbound IdP contract for tenant provisioning and deprovisioning, tenant-scoped user provisioning and deprovisioning, and user listing. AM defines the expected lifecycle outcomes and deterministic public error categories; the concrete provider protocol, provider credentials, federation setup, and session policy remain owned by the IdP implementation and the platform AuthN layer. The IdP contract is intentionally separate from the AuthN Resolver contract because AM performs low-frequency administrative operations, while AuthN Resolver handles request-path token validation.

### 3.3 Barrier Tenant Isolation

AM stores the tenant mode (`managed` or `self-managed`) and the hierarchy state that downstream [Tenant Resolver](../../tenant-resolver) and [AuthZ Resolver](../../authz-resolver) use to enforce visibility. In the normal platform mode:

- managed children remain eligible for delegated parent access per policy;
- self-managed children create a visibility barrier between parent and child subtrees;
- nested self-managed boundaries are allowed;
- authorized platform-owned consumers such as Billing System may use platform-level barrier-bypass modes outside AM itself.

AM may still perform internal hierarchy-owner reads for two non-policy purposes: validating structure-changing operations against the full tenant tree, and stopping metadata inheritance at self-managed boundaries. The only product-level visibility exception that AM exposes directly is parent-side discovery of child conversion requests, and that exception returns only minimal request metadata needed for the dual-consent workflow.

### 3.4 User Data Ownership

AM coordinates user lifecycle operations but **does not own user identity data**. The ownership boundaries are:

| Data | System of record | AM role |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| User identity, credentials, authentication state, session policy | IdP / platform AuthN | Not stored by AM. |
| User-tenant binding | IdP | AM coordinates create/delete/query operations against the binding but does not become the canonical store. |
| User-group hierarchy and membership | Resource Group | AM depends on RG for structure and membership storage. |
| User identifiers in audit records | Platform audit infrastructure | AM emits IdP-issued UUID identity references for traceability only. |

**Key invariants**:

- IdP is the single source of truth for "user X exists and belongs to tenant Y."
- User IDs exposed through AM are IdP-issued UUIDs; AM passes them through for audit and Resource Group integration but does not mint a separate user identity model.
- AM stores no credentials, no profile cache, and no local user projection.
- Group membership cleanup after user deprovisioning is a future cross-module lifecycle capability and is not solved in v1.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

- Platform bootstrap: initial root tenant auto-creation during install, idempotent (p1).
- Tenant type classification via GTS registry with configurable parent-child constraints (p1).
- Tenant hierarchy: single rooted tree with parent-child relationships and unlimited depth with a configurable advisory threshold (p1).
- Managed tenant model: parent eligible for delegated child administration with no barrier, subject to platform authorization policy (p1).
- Self-managed tenant model: strict isolation via barrier; metadata inheritance stops at self-managed boundaries (p1).
- Tenant CRUD operations: create, read, update, soft-delete with configurable retention (p1).
- IdP user operations contract: pluggable contract for user provisioning, deprovisioning, and query (p1).
- User groups management (via Resource Group): create groups, manage membership, nested groups with cycle detection delegated to Resource Group (p1).
- Observability metrics: domain-specific metrics exported via platform observability conventions (OpenTelemetry) (p1).
- Extensible tenant metadata: GTS-registered schemas for tenant-specific data kinds (e.g., branding, contacts) with per-schema inheritance policy and validation (p2).
- Tenant mode conversion: any post-creation managed/self-managed transition uses the same dual-consent `ConversionRequest` flow in either direction, with inbound conversion request discovery for parent admins (p3).

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- User self-registration: users are provisioned via API within tenant security context (invite model only).
- User authentication flows: covered by IAM PRD.
- Tenant context propagation (SecurityContext population, cross-tenant rejection, service-to-service forwarding): framework and AuthZ Resolver responsibility.
- Barrier-aware tenant tree traversal (ancestor chains, descendant queries with `BarrierMode`): Tenant Resolver Plugin responsibility. AM provides source-of-truth data and direct children queries.
- AuthZ Resolver (PDP) implementation: covered by Cyber Fabric DESIGN; this module covers the tenant model consumed by PDP.
- Resource provisioning and lifecycle for non-identity platform resources: outside AM scope. AM provides tenant context and ownership boundaries but does not manage downstream resource CRUD or provisioning workflows.
- Tenant lifecycle events (CloudEvents): deferred until EVT (Events and Audit Bus) is introduced.

## 5. Functional Requirements

> **Testing strategy**: All requirements verified via automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) targeting 90%+ code coverage unless otherwise specified. Document verification method only for non-test approaches (analysis, inspection, demonstration).

### 5.1 Platform Bootstrap

#### Root Tenant Auto-Creation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-root-tenant-creation`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** automatically create the initial root tenant when the AM service starts for the first time during platform installation and complete bootstrap with the root tenant visible in status `active`. The root tenant type is determined by deployment configuration (typically the top-level type in the GTS tenant type hierarchy, e.g., `provider` or `root`).

- **Rationale**: The root tenant is the foundation of the tenant tree; without it, no other tenants or operations can exist.

#### Root Tenant IdP Linking

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-root-tenant-idp-link`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

During bootstrap, the system **MUST** invoke the tenant-provisioning operation for the root tenant — the same IdP integration contract used for every tenant creation — forwarding deployer-configured metadata so the IdP provider plugin can establish the tenant-to-IdP binding. The provider determines the appropriate action: adopting an existing IdP context (e.g., Keycloak master realm), creating a new one, or any other provider-specific behavior. If the provider returns provisioning metadata, AM persists it as tenant metadata; if the provider returns no metadata (binding established through external configuration or convention), AM proceeds normally. AM does not require identifier equality between its tenant UUID and the IdP's internal identifiers, nor does it validate binding sufficiency — that is the provider's responsibility. The initial Platform Administrator user identity is pre-provisioned in the IdP during infrastructure setup; AM does not create this user.

- **Rationale**: AM's obligation is to invoke the IdP contract at the right lifecycle moment and persist whatever the provider returns. Whether the binding is established through returned metadata, external IdP configuration, or convention is deployment-specific and provider-owned. AM owns the tenant model, not user identities — the IdP is the source of truth for admin credentials and authentication. The metadata pass-through keeps AM IdP-agnostic while giving the provider plugin enough context to determine deployment-specific behavior.

#### Bootstrap Idempotency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-bootstrap-idempotency`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The system **MUST** detect an existing root tenant during platform upgrade or AM restart and preserve it without duplication; bootstrap **MUST** be a no-op when the root tenant already exists.

- **Rationale**: Platform upgrades and service restarts must not corrupt the tenant tree by creating a duplicate root tenant.

#### Bootstrap Ordering

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-bootstrap-ordering`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** wait for the IdP to be available before completing bootstrap, retrying with backoff, and failing after a configurable timeout if the IdP is not ready.

- **Rationale**: The root tenant cannot be fully operational without its associated IdP; proceeding without it would leave the platform in an inconsistent state.

### 5.2 Tenant Hierarchy Management

**Cross-cutting: Concurrency semantics** — Hierarchy-mutating operations (create, delete, status change, mode conversion) on overlapping tenant scopes **MUST** produce deterministic, serializable outcomes. Concurrent mutations on the same tenant **MUST** resolve without data corruption; conflicting operations **MUST** fail with the appropriate deterministic error category rather than producing partial state.

#### Create Child Tenant

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-create-child-tenant`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow an authenticated parent tenant administrator to create a new child tenant with a parent reference, establishing the parent-child relationship immediately and making the tenant visible in status `active` once creation completes successfully.

- **Rationale**: Creating sub-tenants is the core operation that builds the organizational hierarchy for all tenant models.

#### Tenant Hierarchy Depth Limit

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-hierarchy-depth-limit`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** support a configurable hierarchy depth advisory threshold (default: 10 levels). When a child tenant creation would exceed the threshold, the system **MUST** emit an operator-visible warning signal and **MUST NOT** reject the operation. In v1, this warning signal MUST be observable by operators via platform monitoring infrastructure (metric increment and structured log entry); it is not a tenant lifecycle CloudEvent. Operators **MUST** be able to configure a strict mode that rejects creation above the threshold with a `tenant_depth_exceeded` error. The platform data model supports unlimited depth per the platform tenant model specification, but production support beyond the approved deployment profile **MUST** be treated as unsupported until representative performance benchmarks exist for the claimed hierarchy depth and data-volume envelope.

- **Rationale**: The platform architecture defines hierarchy depth as unlimited, but deep hierarchies impact query performance and operational complexity in AM and dependent consumers. A configurable advisory threshold provides operational visibility while preserving flexibility; strict mode is opt-in for deployments that need a hard cap, and benchmark-backed profiles define what is actually supported in production.

#### Tenant Status Change

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-status-change`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow an administrator to change a tenant's status between `active` and `suspended` and **MUST NOT** cascade suspension to child tenants; child tenants **MUST** remain active and fully operational when a parent is suspended. Transitioning to `deleted` is not permitted via status change — deletion **MUST** go through the dedicated soft-delete operation (`cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-soft-delete`) which enforces child/resource-ownership preconditions.

**Operations on a suspended tenant:**

- Child tenant creation under a suspended parent **MUST** be rejected with a `validation` error.
- User provisioning within a suspended tenant **MUST** be rejected with a `validation` error.
- Metadata writes to a suspended tenant **MUST** be rejected with a `validation` error.
- Read operations (tenant details, children query, metadata resolution, user query) **MUST** remain available.
- Status change to `active` (unsuspend) and soft-delete **MUST** remain available.
- Mode conversion initiation from a suspended tenant **MUST** be rejected with a `validation` error.

- **Rationale**: Cascading suspension would disrupt downstream tenants (e.g., suspending a parent must not suspend its children). Each tenant's operational state must be independently controllable. Separating deletion from status updates ensures the child/resource-ownership guards cannot be bypassed. Blocking mutating operations on suspended tenants prevents inconsistent state while preserving read access and the ability to unsuspend or delete.

#### Tenant Soft Delete

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-soft-delete`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The system **MUST** allow deletion of a **non-root** tenant only when it has no non-deleted child tenants and no remaining tenant-owned resource associations in the Resource Group ownership graph, transitioning the tenant to `deleted` status (soft delete). Attempts to delete the root tenant **MUST** be rejected with `code=validation` and `sub_code=root_tenant_cannot_delete`. If non-deleted children exist, deletion **MUST** be rejected with `code=conflict` and `sub_code=tenant_has_children`. If resource associations remain under the tenant's ownership scope, deletion **MUST** be rejected with `code=conflict` and `sub_code=tenant_has_resources`. Hard deletion **MUST** occur after a configurable retention period (default: 90 days). The hard-deletion process **MUST NOT** leave orphaned child tenant records. When a parent and child tenant share the same retention window, the hard-deletion background job **MUST** process leaf tenants before their parents (leaf-first ordering).

- **Rationale**: Preventing deletion of tenants with active children or remaining resource ownership links protects organizational integrity and prevents orphaned ownership mappings. The root tenant is undeletable so the deployment always retains exactly one hierarchy root. Soft delete with retention enables recovery and compliance. Ensuring no orphaned child records prevents referential integrity violations during retention cleanup.

#### Children Query with Pagination

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-children-query`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** return direct children of a given tenant with pagination support and optional status filtering.

- **Rationale**: Tenant administrators need a predictable way to browse and manage immediate children; deeper barrier-aware traversal is handled by Tenant Resolver.

#### Read Tenant Details

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-read`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The system **MUST** return tenant details for a requested tenant identifier when the caller is authorized for that tenant scope. The response **MUST** include the tenant's identifier, parent reference, type, status, mode, and the timestamps required for administrative workflows and auditing.

- **Rationale**: Administrators need a reliable way to inspect current tenant state before making lifecycle, support, billing, and policy decisions.

#### Update Tenant Mutable Fields

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-update`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The system **MUST** allow an authorized administrator to update only mutable tenant attributes through the general update operation: `name` and `status` (limited to `active` ↔ `suspended` transitions; `deleted` is handled exclusively by the soft-delete operation). The system **MUST** reject attempts to modify immutable hierarchy-defining fields such as `id`, `parent_id`, `tenant_type`, `self_managed`, and `depth`; mode changes remain handled by the dedicated conversion flow.

- **Rationale**: Administrative workflows require controlled edits to tenant presentation and lifecycle state without allowing accidental hierarchy or mode mutations through a generic update path. Restricting the update path to non-terminal status transitions ensures deletion guards (child/resource checks) cannot be bypassed.

### 5.3 Tenant Type Enforcement

#### Tenant Type Validation via GTS

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-type-enforcement`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-gts-registry`

The system **MUST** enforce parent-child type constraints at creation time using the GTS types registry. Each tenant type defines `allowed_parent_types`. The system **MUST** reject creation when the child type is not permitted under the parent's type.

- **Rationale**: Enforcing type-based parent constraints ensures the business hierarchy remains well-formed and prevents invalid organizational structures.

Type topology is deployment-specific. Examples:

| Deployment model | Tenant types | Type rules |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Flat** | `tenant` | `allowed_parent_types: []` — root type configured at bootstrap, no nesting |
| **Cloud hosting** | `provider`, `reseller`, `customer` | provider can parent reseller and customer; reseller can parent customer; customer is leaf |
| **Education** | `consortium`, `university`, `college` | consortium is root; university under consortium; college under university |
| **Enterprise** | `hq`, `region`, `unit` | hq is root; region under hq; unit under region |

#### Tenant Type Nesting

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-type-nesting`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow same-type nesting when the GTS type definition permits it (e.g., `region` under `region` for multi-level structures) while maintaining an acyclic hierarchy.

- **Rationale**: Some real tenant topologies require repeated organizational tiers, and forbidding valid same-type nesting would force artificial type taxonomies.

### 5.4 Managed/Self-Managed Tenant Modes

#### Managed Tenant Creation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-managed-tenant-creation`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow a child tenant to be created directly in managed mode, establishing no visibility barrier between parent and child and leaving delegated parent access eligible for downstream policy evaluation.

- **Rationale**: The managed tenant model enables delegated administration where parent tenants directly manage child tenant environments.

#### Self-Managed Tenant Creation

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-self-managed-tenant-creation`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow a child tenant to be created directly in self-managed mode, establishing a visibility barrier so the parent has no default access to the child's APIs or resources.

- **Rationale**: The self-managed model enables autonomous operation where the child tenant operates independently with full isolation from the parent.

#### Mode Conversion Approval

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-mode-conversion-approval`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

Any post-creation change between managed and self-managed mode **MUST** use a durable dual-consent `ConversionRequest`: one side initiates, the counterparty approves, and each side acts only from its own tenant scope. Root tenants **MUST NOT** be convertible.

- **Rationale**: Both directions change the trust boundary between parent and child, so both directions need bilateral consent.

#### Mode Conversion Expiry

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-mode-conversion-expiry`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

Pending conversion requests **MUST** expire after the configured approval window if they remain unresolved, and expiry **MUST NOT** change the tenant's current mode.

- **Rationale**: Expiry prevents indefinite outstanding trust-boundary changes.

#### Mode Conversion Single Pending Invariant

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-mode-conversion-single-pending`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

At most one pending conversion request **MUST** exist for a tenant at any time.

- **Rationale**: Competing pending requests create ambiguous operator intent and unclear approval ownership.

#### Mode Conversion Consistent Apply

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-mode-conversion-consistent-apply`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

Approving a conversion request **MUST** produce a consistent outcome in which the request resolution and the tenant mode change become visible together, or neither does.

- **Rationale**: Review and enforcement cannot tolerate a state where approval history and barrier state disagree.

#### Creation-Time Self-Managed Declaration

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-conversion-creation-time-self-managed`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

Creating a child tenant directly in self-managed mode **MUST NOT** require a conversion request. Only post-creation mode changes require the dual-consent flow.

- **Rationale**: A child tenant must not become self-managed behind the parent's back at any moment. At creation time the parent is the sole party with admin authority over the new tenant; requiring a separate `ConversionRequest` would be ceremonial overhead with no protective value.

#### Inbound Conversion Requests Query

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-child-conversions-query`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow a parent tenant administrator to discover conversion requests targeting direct children, with filtering and pagination, while exposing only minimal conversion-request metadata and not the child's full tenant record.

- **Rationale**: Without a dedicated query endpoint, the parent admin has no way to discover pending conversion requests from self-managed children — the barrier blocks normal child visibility, creating a functional gap in the dual-consent flow. Exposing only conversion-request metadata (not child tenant data) preserves barrier semantics while enabling the approval workflow.

#### Conversion Request Cancellation by Initiator

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-conversion-cancel`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow only the initiator of a pending conversion request to withdraw it. Withdrawal **MUST** transition the request to `cancelled` and **MUST NOT** alter the tenant's current mode.

- **Rationale**: Without an explicit withdraw path, the initiator's only way to dismiss their own mistaken or outdated request is to wait for the approval window to expire. The semantic "I changed my mind" is distinct from "they declined" and is therefore expressed as a distinct state (`cancelled`) rather than collapsed with counterparty rejection.

#### Conversion Request Rejection by Counterparty

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-conversion-reject`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The system **MUST** allow only the counterparty of a pending conversion request to decline it. Rejection **MUST** transition the request to `rejected` and **MUST NOT** alter the tenant's current mode.

- **Rationale**: Counterparty rejection is semantically distinct from initiator withdrawal — the former conveys active disagreement with the proposed mode change, the latter conveys that the initiator no longer wants it. Keeping them as distinct terminal states enables precise UX ("your request was rejected by the parent" vs. "you withdrew this request"), attribution of reject/cancel rates in metrics, and policy hooks that may later depend on which side resolved the request.

#### Resolved Conversion Request Retention

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-conversion-retention`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

Resolved conversion requests (`approved`, `cancelled`, `rejected`, `expired`) **MUST** remain queryable for a configurable review window and then leave the default API surface while remaining available to retained audit/history flows.

- **Rationale**: Historical resolutions carry audit and UX value — "my last conversion attempt was rejected two weeks ago" must remain answerable without forcing unbounded storage growth. A configurable retention window gives operators a single knob to balance audit needs, operational clarity, and storage cost.

### 5.5 IdP Tenant & User Operations Contract

AM uses an outbound IdP integration contract. The public AM contract defines when those operations must occur and which failure classes are visible to consumers; the provider-specific transport and payload details belong to the IdP contract and the OpenAPI artifact.

#### Tenant IdP Provisioning

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-idp-tenant-provision`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** invoke the IdP tenant-provisioning operation after every successful tenant creation, including bootstrap creation of the root tenant, and **MUST** pass the tenant identity plus deployment-supplied provisioning context required by the provider.

- **Rationale**: Providers need a lifecycle hook to establish tenant-scoped identity resources without making AM provider-specific.

#### Tenant IdP Provisioning Failure Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-idp-tenant-provision-failure`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** surface tenant-provisioning failures through deterministic AM error categories. When AM can prove that no IdP-side tenant state was retained, the failure **MUST** be exposed as a clean retryable failure. When the external outcome may already have been retained, the failure **MUST** be exposed as requiring reconciliation before retry rather than inviting blind automatic retry.

- **Rationale**: Tenant creation crosses a trust boundary into an external identity system and therefore needs an explicit reconciliation contract.

#### Tenant IdP Deprovisioning

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-idp-tenant-deprovision`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** invoke tenant deprovisioning during hard deletion so the provider can clean up tenant-scoped identity resources before AM removes the tenant permanently.

- **Rationale**: Symmetric to tenant provisioning — providers that create per-tenant IdP resources need a lifecycle hook to clean them up. Running at hard-deletion time (not soft-delete) ensures the IdP resources remain available during the retention window in case the tenant is restored.

#### User Provisioning

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-idp-user-provision`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** provision users within a tenant scope through the IdP integration contract and bind the resulting user identity to that tenant.

- **Rationale**: Tenant-scoped provisioning is the primary administrative bridge between AM and a pluggable IdP implementation.

#### User Deprovisioning

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-idp-user-deprovision`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** deprovision users through the IdP integration contract and treat an already-absent IdP user as a successful no-op.

- **Rationale**: Deprovisioning through the shared contract keeps AM intent and IdP identity state aligned while closing access promptly.

#### User Tenant Query

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-idp-user-query`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

The system **MUST** support tenant-scoped user listing and point-existence checks through the IdP integration contract.

- **Rationale**: Tenant-scoped user queries are required for administration and support. User-ID filtering enables callers to verify user existence before adding them to a Resource Group.

### 5.6 User Groups Management

User groups are implemented as [Resource Group](../../resource-group/docs/PRD.md) entities. AM ensures the required Resource Group type exists and coordinates cleanup at tenant retirement, but consumers use Resource Group directly for group hierarchy and membership operations.

#### User Group Resource Group Type Registration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-user-group-rg-type`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

AM **MUST** register (or require via seeding) the chained Resource Group type schema `gts.x.core.rg.type.v1~x.core.am.user_group.v1~` for user groups. Its `allowed_memberships` **MUST** include the platform user resource type `gts.x.core.am.user.v1~`, and its `allowed_parents` **MUST** include itself to support nested groups. Tenant-scoped placement is enforced by Resource Group's ownership-graph rules rather than encoded as a schema trait. Registration happens during AM module initialization.

- **Rationale**: A dedicated Resource Group type ensures user group operations are governed by the same typed hierarchy, forest invariants, and tenant isolation rules as all other Resource Group entities, without reimplementing group infrastructure in AM.

#### User Group Lifecycle via Resource Group

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-user-group-lifecycle`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow a tenant administrator to create, update, and delete user groups within their tenant scope by using Resource Group directly. Group-identity uniqueness and hierarchy integrity are enforced by Resource Group; AM does not proxy those CRUD operations.

- **Rationale**: Resource Group already provides typed hierarchy, tenant scoping, and forest invariants. A separate AM proxy layer would add no domain logic beyond pass-through. AM's tenant-scoped user-query capability provides the valid user set that callers combine with Resource Group membership operations.

#### User Group Membership via Resource Group

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-user-group-membership`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow a tenant administrator to add and remove users from groups through Resource Group membership operations while using AM's user-query capability to verify that referenced users exist.

- **Rationale**: Administrators need direct control of membership; Resource Group's existing membership contract (composite key, tenant-scoping, conflict detection) satisfies this without duplication. User existence validation is a caller responsibility, not a structural invariant.

#### Nested User Groups

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-nested-user-groups`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** support nested user groups through Resource Group's parent-child hierarchy, with cycle prevention delegated to Resource Group.

- **Rationale**: Resource Group already provides strict forest enforcement (single parent, no cycles) and closure-table traversal — reusing it avoids duplicating cycle detection and hierarchy query logic.

### 5.7 Extensible Tenant Metadata

#### Tenant Metadata Schema Registration

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-metadata-schema`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-gts-registry`

The system **MUST** support extensible tenant metadata through GTS-registered schemas. Each schema defines validation rules and an inheritance policy, and new metadata categories **MUST** be introducible without AM code changes.

- **Rationale**: A generic metadata mechanism avoids feature-specific APIs for each new tenant data category. Branding, company contacts, billing addresses, and future tenant attributes all share the same storage, validation, and inheritance contract.

#### Tenant Metadata CRUD

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-metadata-crud`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** allow tenant-scoped create, read, update, and delete of metadata entries for registered schemas, with writes validated against the selected schema.

- **Rationale**: Tenant administrators need self-service control over tenant-specific data without platform-level intervention for each new metadata schema.

#### Tenant Metadata Resolution API

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-metadata-api`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** provide effective-value resolution for tenant metadata based on the schema's inheritance policy. For inheritable schemas, resolution **MUST** stop at self-managed boundaries.

- **Rationale**: A single resolution API with a per-schema `inheritance_policy` trait gives consumers one consistent contract instead of re-implementing resolution per metadata schema. Stopping inheritance at self-managed boundaries preserves the core isolation invariant — a self-managed tenant is fully independent, including its metadata — without requiring `BarrierMode::Ignore` for metadata operations.

#### Tenant Metadata Listing

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-metadata-list`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The system **MUST** expose a listing capability for metadata entries written directly on a tenant, separate from effective-value resolution, and that capability **MUST** respect the same tenant/barrier visibility model as other AM reads.

- **Rationale**: Tenant administration UIs and automation need to discover which metadata schemas a tenant has populated without probing schemas one by one. Discovery is required before any editor, export, or diagnostics surface can be built, and it is the minimal complement to direct per-schema metadata management.

#### Per-Schema Metadata Permissions

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-tenant-metadata-permissions`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

The metadata permission model **MUST** allow authorization policies to restrict access by `schema_id`, not only by tenant.

- **Rationale**: Real deployments separate duties between functions (marketing, finance, operations, legal) and storing all these categories behind a single coarse "tenant metadata" action would force ops teams to grant over-broad access. Carrying `schema_id` into the AuthZ request keeps AM's own contract simple while letting policy authors scope permissions to the categories they own.

### 5.8 Deterministic Error Semantics

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-deterministic-errors`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The module **MUST** map failures to stable public categories:

- `validation`
- `not_found`
- `conflict`
- `cross_tenant_denied` (barrier violation, unauthorized cross-tenant access, non-platform-admin attempting root-tenant-scoped operations)
- `idp_unavailable` (IdP contract call failed or timed out)
- `idp_unsupported_operation` (IdP implementation does not support the requested administrative operation)
- `service_unavailable`
- `internal`

- **Rationale**: Stable failure categories let clients and operators react consistently across tenant models and IdP providers.

The authoritative HTTP mapping, response fields, and stable sub-codes are defined in the OpenAPI contract. Provider-specific diagnostics may appear in audit trails or problem details without changing the public `code`.

### 5.9 Observability Metrics

#### Domain-Specific Metrics Export

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-observability-metrics`

**Actors**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

The module **MUST** export domain-specific metrics for dependency health, metadata resolution, bootstrap lifecycle, tenant-retention work, conversion lifecycle, hierarchy-depth threshold exceedance, and cross-tenant denials. Metric naming and exposure **MUST** follow platform observability conventions.

- **Rationale**: Operators need visibility into AM-specific domain operations (external dependency health, internal sub-operation latencies, security event counts) that platform-level middleware cannot provide. The boundary between platform-provided and module-internal metrics is an implementation concern owned by the DESIGN.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

> **Global baselines**: Project-wide NFRs (performance, security, reliability, scalability) defined in root PRD. Document only module-specific NFRs here: **exclusions** from defaults or **standalone** requirements.
>
> **Testing strategy**: NFRs verified via automated benchmarks, security scans, and monitoring unless otherwise specified.

### 6.1 Tenant Context Validation Latency

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-context-validation-latency`

AM data access and source-of-truth lookups **MUST** enable end-to-end tenant-context validation to complete in p95 ≤ 5ms under normal load when resolver-side caching is enabled.

- **Threshold**: 5ms at p95 across the full tenant-context validation path under the approved deployment profile.
- **Rationale**: AM is not the request-path enforcement point, but its source-of-truth query model must not block the platform SLO.

### 6.2 Authentication Context

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-authentication-context`

AM API endpoints **MUST** require authenticated requests via platform `SecurityContext`.

- **Inherited ownership**: Token validation, session renewal, federation, credential policy, and MFA policy are inherited from [docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md) and the configured IdP provider.
- **AM-specific addendum**: AM defines only the extra administrative identity requirements unique to this module, namely tenant-scoped administrative user operations and preservation of tenant identity context in audit records.

### 6.3 Tenant Isolation Integrity

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-tenant-isolation`

Tenant A **MUST NOT** be able to access Tenant B data through any API or data access path, verified by automated security tests.

- **Threshold**: Zero cross-tenant data leaks in automated security and integration testing.
- **Verification Method**: Cross-tenant access attempts against both managed and self-managed hierarchies.

### 6.4 Audit Trail Completeness

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-audit-completeness`

Every tenant configuration change **MUST** be recorded in the platform append-only audit infrastructure with actor identity, tenant identity, and change details. AM **MUST** emit `actor=system` audit records through that same platform sink for non-request transitions it owns, including bootstrap completion, conversion expiry, provisioning-reaper compensation, and hard-delete / tenant-deprovision cleanup.

- **Threshold**: 100% of AM-owned state changes recorded; zero known audit gaps.
- **Inherited controls**: Audit retention, tamper resistance, and security-monitoring integration are inherited platform controls documented in [docs/security/SECURITY.md](../../../../docs/security/SECURITY.md). AM must emit the events those platform controls rely on.

### 6.5 Barrier Enforcement

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-barrier-enforcement`

AM barrier state and tenant metadata **MUST** be sufficient for Tenant Resolver and AuthZ Resolver to enforce managed and self-managed access controls at the query level. AM **MUST** audit all barrier-state-changing operations it owns (mode conversions, `self_managed` flag writes) per `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-audit-completeness`. Cross-tenant access auditing (barrier traversals, `BarrierMode::Ignore` usage) is a platform AuthZ concern — AM does not observe or audit downstream enforcement decisions.

- **Threshold**: Zero unauthorized cross-barrier accesses attributable to missing or stale AM source data; 100% of AM-owned barrier transitions audited.

### 6.6 Tenant Model Versatility

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-tenant-model-versatility`

The tenant model **MUST** support both managed (no barrier) and self-managed (with barriers) patterns within the same tenant tree, with `BarrierMode` enabling selective barrier bypass for downstream billing and administrative operations.

- **Threshold**: Mixed-mode tenant hierarchies operate correctly under the same deployment profile and authorization model.
- **Rationale**: Supporting both models in one tenant tree is the core product differentiator for AM.

### 6.7 API and SDK Compatibility

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-compatibility`

Published REST APIs **MUST** follow path-based versioning. SDK client and IdP integration contracts are stable interfaces — breaking changes **MUST** follow platform versioning policy and require a new contract version with a migration path for consumers.

- **Inherited runtime compatibility**: AM has no module-specific runtime, OS, or deployment-topology deviations; it inherits standard ModKit runtime, database, and rolling-upgrade compatibility from [docs/modkit_unified_system/README.md](../../../../docs/modkit_unified_system/README.md).
- **Consumer compatibility**: Changes to AM source-of-truth tenant data consumed by Tenant Resolver, AuthZ Resolver, or Billing **MUST** remain backward-compatible within a minor release or publish a coordinated migration path.

### 6.8 Expected Production Scale

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-production-scale`

The platform team **MUST** define and approve a canonical AM deployment profile before DESIGN sign-off. At minimum, the profile **MUST** specify target values for the following dimensions and keep them within, or explicitly revise, the current planning envelope. The approved profile **MUST** include benchmark evidence for the hierarchy depth and volume envelope claimed for production, including dependent resolver paths that consume AM hierarchy data.

| Dimension | Current Planning Envelope |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Tenants (hierarchy nodes) | 1K–100K |
| Typical hierarchy depth | 3–10 levels (AM model has no hard depth cap; advisory threshold default: 10; deeper production support is benchmark-gated) |
| Users (across all tenants) | 10K–1M |
| User groups (Resource Group entities) | 1K–50K (stored in Resource Group) |
| Group memberships (Resource Group membership links) | 10K–500K (stored in Resource Group) |
| Concurrent API requests (peak) | 100–10K rps |

- **Threshold**: 100% of the listed dimensions have an approved target before DESIGN sign-off.
- **Additional throughput targets**:
  - Lifecycle reads must support the approved 1K rps peak without violating NFR 6.1.
  - Administrative mutations must sustain at least 25 writes/second for a 15-minute window under the approved profile.
  - Background expiry and retention work must be able to clear a backlog of 10K due rows within 60 minutes under the approved profile.
- **Rationale**: AM indexing, job cadence, and consumer freshness expectations depend on explicit scale and throughput inputs rather than implicit assumptions.

### 6.9 Data Classification

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-data-classification`

AM persists tenant hierarchy data, tenant metadata, conversion-request state, and IdP-issued UUID identity references only where needed for traceability. User group structure is stored by Resource Group, and credentials/profile data remain owned by the IdP.

- **Classification baseline**:
  - Tenant hierarchy and tenant-mode data: Internal / Confidential.
  - Opaque identity references in audit records: PII-adjacent and platform-protected.
  - Extensible metadata: classification defined per registered GTS schema.
- **Inherited legal/privacy ownership**: Data residency, DSAR orchestration, retention-policy administration, and privacy-by-default controls are inherited platform obligations. AM-specific obligations are to minimize persisted identity data, avoid storing credentials/profile data, and treat IdP-linked payloads as transient administrative data.
- **Threshold**: 100% of AM-owned persisted data categories mapped to a classification level; zero authentication credentials or IdP profile PII stored by AM outside the platform audit infrastructure.

### 6.10 Reliability

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-reliability`

AM inherits the platform core infrastructure SLA (target: 99.9% uptime). During IdP outages, AM **MUST** continue serving tenant reads, child listing, status reads, and metadata resolution from AM-owned data while failing only the IdP-dependent operations. Tenant creation remains intentionally non-idempotent across ambiguous external failures. Platform recovery targets remain RPO ≤ 1 hour and RTO ≤ 15 minutes.

### 6.11 Data Lifecycle

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-data-lifecycle`

Tenant deprovisioning **MUST** remove tenant-scoped metadata, trigger Resource Group cleanup for tenant-scoped user groups, and invoke IdP tenant deprovisioning before final hard deletion. Soft-deleted tenants are hard-deleted after the configured retention period.

- **Threshold**: 100% of AM-owned tenant-scoped metadata removed during deprovisioning; tenant hard deletion occurs after the configured retention period.

### 6.12 Data Quality

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-data-quality`

AM hierarchy changes **MUST** be committed transactionally and become immediately visible in the source-of-truth tenant tables. Mandatory fields **MUST** be validated before persistence. The downstream 30-second projection freshness target remains a platform-level objective that depends on Tenant Resolver's sync behavior.

#### Data Integrity Diagnostics

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-data-integrity-diagnostics`

AM **MUST** provide diagnostic checks for hierarchy integrity anomalies that it can observe directly, including orphaned children, broken parent references, and depth mismatches.

#### Data Remediation Expectations

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-data-remediation`

AM-owned integrity anomalies and compensation failures **MUST** produce operator-visible telemetry within 15 minutes of detection and a documented remediation path that can be triaged within one business day. Cross-module cleanup gaps that AM cannot correct automatically **MUST** remain explicitly surfaced rather than silently ignored.

#### Operational Metrics Treatment

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-nfr-ops-metrics-treatment`

AM domain metrics **MUST** be integrated into shared platform dashboards and alert routing. At minimum, operator treatment **MUST** exist for IdP failure rate, bootstrap not-ready state, provisioning reaper activity, integrity-check violations, and background cleanup failures.

### NFR Exclusions

- **Offline support**: Not applicable. AM is a server-side platform service and does not operate in offline mode.
- **Usability (UX)**: Not applicable at module level — AM exposes REST API and SDK traits. Portal UI is a separate concern.
- **Compliance (COMPL)**: Regulatory programs and certifications remain platform-level obligations. AM's module-specific contribution is captured in NFRs 6.4 and 6.9.
- **Safety (SAFE)**: Not applicable — AM is a pure information system with no physical interaction or safety-critical operations.
- **Operations (OPS)**: Deployment topology, on-call process, and runbook ownership are inherited platform concerns. AM-specific observability treatment is captured in NFR 6.12.
- **Maintainability / Documentation (MAINT)**: Consumer-facing contract publication and architectural sync rules are defined in DESIGN, not in this PRD.
- **Geographic distribution**: Not applicable at module level — AM follows platform deployment topology. Data residency and cross-region replication are platform infrastructure concerns.
- **Rate limiting**: Not applicable at module level — API rate limiting is enforced by the platform API gateway. AM does not implement module-specific throttling.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

The authoritative wire contract for the public REST surface is [account-management-v1.yaml](./account-management-v1.yaml). The entries below describe the stable capability surfaces that the contract file elaborates.

#### Tenant Management API

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-interface-tenant-mgmt-api`

- **Type**: REST API
- **Stability**: stable
- **Description**: API for tenant CRUD operations, direct-child discovery, mode-transition workflows, and the public tenant view consumed by downstream readers.
- **Breaking Change Policy**: Major version bump required for endpoint removal or incompatible request/response schema changes.

#### Tenant Metadata API

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-interface-tenant-metadata-api`

- **Type**: REST API
- **Stability**: stable
- **Description**: API for CRUD, listing, and effective-value resolution of extensible tenant metadata defined by GTS-registered schemas.
- **Breaking Change Policy**: Major version bump required for endpoint removal or incompatible request/response schema changes.

#### User Operations API

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-interface-user-ops-api`

- **Type**: REST API
- **Stability**: stable
- **Description**: API for tenant-scoped user provisioning, deprovisioning, and query operations delegated to the configured IdP provider contract.
- **Breaking Change Policy**: Major version bump required for endpoint removal or incompatible request/response schema changes.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

IdP implementations may align with standards such as SCIM 2.0 and OIDC where applicable, but AM defines stable behavior in terms of lifecycle outcomes rather than provider protocol details.

#### IdP Provider Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-contract-idp-provider`

- **Direction**: required from client (IdP implementation via pluggable IdP integration contract)
- **Protocol/Format**: Pluggable contract (in-process or remote)
- **Consumed / Provided Data**: tenant lifecycle intent, user lifecycle intent, and provider-specific provisioning context.
- **Availability / Fallback**: AM tolerates IdP unavailability during bootstrap with retry/backoff. Read-only tenant and metadata operations remain available during IdP outages; IdP-dependent operations fail deterministically.
- **Compatibility**: Provider implementations are vendor-replaceable. Breaking changes require a versioned contract and migration path.

#### GTS Registry Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-contract-gts-registry`

- **Direction**: required from client (schema/type resolution consumed by AM)
- **Protocol/Format**: SDK trait or equivalent registry API
- **Consumed / Provided Data**: tenant type definitions, allowed-parent rules, metadata-schema validation material, and metadata inheritance traits.
- **Availability / Fallback**: Existing AM reads remain available if GTS is unavailable. Type-validating writes and metadata writes that require fresh schema lookup fail with `service_unavailable`; AM does not invent or cache unverified schema changes locally.
- **Compatibility**: Registered schema identifiers remain the stable keys by which AM references tenant types and metadata kinds.

#### Tenant Resolver Plugin Data Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-contract-tenant-resolver`

- **Direction**: provided by library (tenant hierarchy data for Resolver consumption)
- **Protocol/Format**: Database-level data contract (source-of-truth tenant tables consumed by Resolver sync)
- **Consumed / Provided Data**: tenant identifiers, parent-child relationships, status, depth, type, and barrier state.
- **Availability / Fallback**: AM provides immediate transactional visibility in source tables. Projection lag and cache freshness are Tenant Resolver responsibilities.
- **Compatibility**: Schema changes to source-of-truth tenant tables require coordinated update with Tenant Resolver Plugin. Schema migrations to source-of-truth tenant tables MUST be backward-compatible within a minor release to support rolling upgrades where AM and Tenant Resolver may temporarily run different versions.

#### AuthZ Resolver Integration

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-contract-authz-resolver`

- **Direction**: provided by library (tenant context and hierarchy data for authorization decisions)
- **Protocol/Format**: SecurityContext propagation via Cyber Fabric framework
- **Consumed / Provided Data**: SecurityContext tenant fields, tenant hierarchy visibility, barrier state, and `schema_id`-scoped metadata authorization attributes.
- **Availability / Fallback**: AM does not provide an authorization fallback path; if AuthZ is unavailable, access decisions remain platform-owned failures.
- **Compatibility**: Changes to SecurityContext tenant fields require coordinated update with AuthZ Resolver Plugin.

#### Billing System Read Contract

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-contract-billing`

- **Direction**: provided by library (read-only tenant and metadata views consumed by Billing System)
- **Protocol/Format**: AM public read APIs and/or SDK traits, subject to platform authorization policy
- **Consumed / Provided Data**: tenant identifiers, hierarchy relationships, tenant status and mode, and billing-relevant metadata resolved by registered schema id.
- **Availability / Fallback**: Billing must not invent hierarchy state when AM is unavailable. It may continue operating on previously synchronized billing snapshots where platform policy allows, but new hierarchy-dependent billing reads fail until AM data is reachable again.
- **Compatibility**: Billing-relevant read shapes follow the AM public versioning policy. Schema-id-based metadata categories remain the extensibility mechanism for new billing attributes.

## 8. Use Cases

### 8.1 Bootstrap

#### Scenario: Root Tenant Auto-Created on First Start

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-root-bootstrap`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

**Preconditions**:
- AM starts for the first time during platform installation
- IdP is available

**Main Flow**:
1. AM starts the bootstrap procedure.
2. System creates the initial root tenant through an internal provisioning flow and completes bootstrap with the tenant visible in status `active` and the configured root type.
3. System invokes the tenant-provisioning operation with the deployer-configured bootstrap metadata (e.g., `{ "adopt_realm": "master" }`), enabling the IdP provider plugin to adopt the pre-existing IdP context and configure tenant identity claim mapping.
4. System writes a bootstrap audit event via the platform audit infrastructure with a `system` actor.

**Postconditions**:
- Initial root tenant exists and is linked to IdP
- Tenant provisioning completed without error; any provider-returned metadata is persisted as tenant metadata
- Bootstrap completion state is persisted for subsequent restarts

**Alternative Flows**:
- **IdP unavailable**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-bootstrap-waits-idp`

#### Scenario: Bootstrap Is Idempotent

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-bootstrap-idempotent`

**Preconditions**:
- Initial root tenant already exists from a previous bootstrap

**Main Flow**:
1. AM restarts or the platform runs an upgrade.
2. Bootstrap checks whether the initial root tenant already exists.
3. System detects the existing tenant and performs no additional create operation.

**Postconditions**:
- No duplicate root tenant is created
- Existing root tenant remains unchanged

**Alternative Flows**:
- **None**: No additional alternative flows beyond standard restart handling

#### Scenario: Bootstrap Waits for IdP

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-bootstrap-waits-idp`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

**Preconditions**:
- AM bootstrap begins
- IdP is not yet available

**Main Flow**:
1. System starts bootstrap and checks IdP availability.
2. System detects that the IdP is unavailable.
3. System retries with backoff until the IdP becomes available or the configured timeout is reached.
4. If the IdP becomes available before the timeout, bootstrap continues.

**Postconditions**:
- Bootstrap resumes only after IdP availability is confirmed, or stops at the timeout boundary

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Timeout expires**: Bootstrap fails with `idp_unavailable`

### 8.2 Tenant Lifecycle

#### Scenario: Create Child Tenant

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T5` has no children
- Tenant `T5` has no remaining resource ownership associations in Resource Group

**Main Flow**:
1. Administrator submits a delete request for `T5`.
2. System validates that `T5` has no children and no remaining resource ownership associations.
3. System transitions `T5` to `deleted` status as a soft delete.
4. System schedules hard deletion after the configured retention period, by default 90 days.

**Postconditions**:
- `T5` is soft-deleted immediately

### 8.3 Managed/Self-Managed Modes

#### Scenario: Create Managed Child Tenant

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-create-managed-child`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Parent tenant `T1` is allowed to create child tenants
- Requested child is created with `self_managed=false`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin creates child tenant `T2` with `self_managed=false`.
2. System persists `T2` as a managed child tenant.
3. System exposes the parent-child relationship without a visibility barrier.

**Postconditions**:
- No visibility barrier exists between `T1` and `T2`

**Alternative Flows**:
- **None**: No additional alternative flows beyond standard policy evaluation

#### Scenario: Create Self-Managed Child Tenant

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-create-self-managed-child`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Parent tenant `T1` is allowed to create child tenants
- Requested child is created with `self_managed=true`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin creates child tenant `T2` with `self_managed=true`.
2. System persists `T2` as a self-managed child tenant.
3. System establishes the visibility barrier for the new subtree.

**Postconditions**:
- Visibility barrier exists between `T1` and `T2`
- `T1` has no access to `T2` APIs or resources by default

**Alternative Flows**:
- **None**: No additional alternative flows beyond standard authorization behavior

#### Scenario: Convert Tenant Mode via Dual Consent

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-convert-dual-consent`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T2` is a non-root direct child of `T1` with status `active`
- No pending conversion request exists for `T2`

**Main Flow**:
1. Admin of one side initiates a mode conversion request from their own tenant scope.
2. System derives the requested target mode from the tenant's current mode, records which side initiated the request, opens the approval window, and returns the created conversion request.
3. Admin of the counterparty resolves the request from their own scope by approving it within the approval window.
4. System makes the request resolution and the tenant mode change visible together and records the completed change via the platform audit infrastructure.

**Postconditions**:
- `tenants.self_managed` on `T2` reflects `target_mode`
- Conversion history shows both the initiating and approving sides with their respective identities
- Downstream barrier state converges once Tenant Resolver's projection picks up the new value (propagation latency is a platform concern, not AM's)

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Counterparty does not approve within the window**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-conversion-expires`
- **Initiator withdraws the request**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-cancel-conversion-by-initiator`
- **Counterparty declines the request**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-reject-conversion-by-counterparty`
- **Wrong side attempts a transition (e.g., initiator tries to approve)**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-invalid-actor-for-transition`
- **Target tenant is the root tenant**: Initiation is rejected with the deterministic validation error for root conversion.

#### Scenario: Conversion Approval Expires

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-conversion-expires`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Pending conversion request exists for `T2`
- Neither side has resolved the request

**Main Flow**:
1. System tracks the approval window for the pending conversion request.
2. The configured approval window elapses without `approved`, `cancelled`, or `rejected` transitions.
3. Background expiry job transitions the row to `expired` and writes an audit entry with a `system` actor.
4. System preserves the existing tenant mode.

**Postconditions**:
- Conversion request status is `expired`
- `tenants.self_managed` on `T2` is unchanged
- A new conversion request can be initiated after expiry

**Alternative Flows**:
- **None**: No additional alternative flows beyond expiration handling

#### Scenario: Parent Discovers Pending Child Conversions

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-discover-child-conversions`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Parent tenant `T1` exists with status `active`
- Self-managed child tenant `T2` exists under `T1` with a visibility barrier
- Child admin of `T2` has initiated a mode conversion (pending request exists)

**Main Flow**:
1. Parent admin asks to see pending conversion requests that target direct children of `T1` from the parent-scope discovery surface.
2. System returns a paginated list of conversion requests targeting direct children of `T1`.
3. Each entry includes the child tenant identity, initiating side, requested target mode, lifecycle status, and review timestamps needed to act on the request.
4. Parent admin reviews the pending request and either approves, rejects, or leaves it for expiry.

**Postconditions**:
- Parent admin has visibility into pending requests from barrier-isolated children without any barrier bypass
- No child tenant data beyond conversion-request metadata is exposed

**Alternative Flows**:
- **No pending requests**: Empty result set is returned
- **Operator wants historical view**: System can return recently resolved requests that remain inside the configured retention window through an operator-authorized history workflow

#### Scenario: Initiator Withdraws a Pending Conversion Request

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-cancel-conversion-by-initiator`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- A pending conversion request exists for tenant `T2`
- The caller represents the same side that initiated the request

**Main Flow**:
1. Initiator admin requests withdrawal of the pending conversion from their own tenant scope.
2. System validates that the request is pending and that the caller's side matches the initiator side.
3. System transitions the row to `cancelled`, stamps `cancelled_by = caller`, and writes an audit entry.

**Postconditions**:
- Conversion request status is `cancelled`
- `tenants.self_managed` on `T2` is unchanged
- A new conversion request can be initiated after cancellation

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Counterparty attempts to cancel**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-invalid-actor-for-transition`

#### Scenario: Counterparty Rejects a Pending Conversion Request

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-reject-conversion-by-counterparty`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- A pending conversion request exists for tenant `T2`
- The caller represents the counterparty side of the initiator

**Main Flow**:
1. Counterparty admin declines the pending conversion from their own tenant scope.
2. System validates that the request is pending and that the caller's side is the counterparty.
3. System transitions the row to `rejected`, stamps `rejected_by = caller`, and writes an audit entry.

**Postconditions**:
- Conversion request status is `rejected`
- `tenants.self_managed` on `T2` is unchanged
- The initiator sees in the list that their request was declined by the counterparty (distinct from their own `cancelled`)

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Initiator attempts to reject their own request**: See `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-invalid-actor-for-transition`

#### Scenario: Invalid Actor for Transition

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-invalid-actor-for-transition`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- A pending conversion request exists for tenant `T2`

**Main Flow**:
1. An actor from the wrong side attempts a transition that their side is not allowed to drive, such as an initiator trying to approve or reject, or a counterparty trying to cancel.
2. AM detects the role/status mismatch before any state change is applied.
3. System returns the deterministic "invalid actor for transition" conflict response with enough detail for the caller to understand which transition was rejected.

**Postconditions**:
- Conversion request state is unchanged (still `pending`)
- Caller can disambiguate which role/status combination was rejected from the deterministic error details

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Request is already resolved (approved/cancelled/rejected/expired)**: System returns `409 conflict` with sub-code `already_resolved` instead of `invalid_actor_for_transition`

#### Scenario: Retention of Resolved Conversion Requests

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-retention-of-resolved-conversion`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-platform-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Conversion requests in status `approved`, `cancelled`, `rejected`, or `expired` exist beyond the configured resolved-retention window (default 30 days)

**Main Flow**:
1. The AM retention background job identifies resolved requests that have aged past the configured review window.
2. Job removes those requests from the default day-to-day discovery surface while preserving them temporarily for retained history and audit workflows.
3. Subsequent hard-delete cadence permanently removes the retained history records.

**Postconditions**:
- Day-to-day API listings stay focused on recent activity
- Operator tooling can still inspect retained history until hard deletion
- Pending-request safeguards continue to apply only to active review items, not to already resolved history

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Operator queries all retained history**: A privileged operator workflow may inspect retained history that is no longer part of the standard tenant-admin surface

### 8.4 User Groups

> User group operations are performed by consumers directly via the [Resource Group module](../../resource-group/docs/PRD.md). AM's role is limited to registering the user-group RG type at module initialization and triggering tenant-scoped group cleanup during hard-deletion. Structural invariants (cycle detection, forest enforcement, tenant scoping) are enforced by Resource Group; see [Resource Group use cases](../../resource-group/docs/PRD.md#8-use-cases).

#### Scenario: Create User Group via Resource Group

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-create-user-group`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` exists with status `active`
- User-group Resource Group type `gts.x.core.rg.type.v1~x.core.am.user_group.v1~` is registered with `allowed_memberships` including `gts.x.core.am.user.v1~`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin calls the Resource Group API directly to create a Resource Group entity of the user-group type within tenant scope `T1`.
2. Resource Group validates type compatibility, tenant scope, and forest invariants; persists the group.

**Postconditions**:
- Group exists as a Resource Group entity within tenant `T1`
- Group identifier is unique within the tenant scope (enforced by Resource Group)

> AM is not in the call path — the consumer interacts with Resource Group directly.

#### Scenario: Manage Group Membership via Resource Group

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-manage-group-membership`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- User-group Resource Group entity `G1` exists in tenant `T1`
- User `U1` belongs to tenant `T1` (verified via AM's tenant-scoped user-query capability)

**Main Flow**:
1. Admin adds `U1` to `G1` through the Resource Group membership API.
2. Resource Group validates tenant compatibility and stores the membership link.
3. Admin removes `U1` from `G1` through the same Resource Group membership API.
4. Resource Group removes the membership link.

**Postconditions**:
- Group membership reflects the most recent update
- `U1` is no longer a member of `G1`

> AM is not in the call path — the consumer interacts with Resource Group directly. User existence verification is the caller's responsibility (via AM's tenant-scoped user-query capability).

#### Scenario: Reject Circular Group Nesting (Resource Group Invariant)

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-reject-circular-nesting`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Nested user-group Resource Group entities `G1 → G2 → G3` already exist

**Main Flow**:
1. Admin requests Resource Group to move `G1` under `G3`.
2. Resource Group evaluates forest invariants and detects a cycle.
3. Resource Group rejects the operation with `CycleDetected`.

**Postconditions**:
- Existing nesting structure is preserved
- Caller receives `CycleDetected` error directly from Resource Group

> AM is not in the call path — cycle detection is a Resource Group invariant. `CycleDetected` is an RG-owned error, not part of AM's error contract.

### 8.5 IdP User Operations

#### Scenario: Provision User in Tenant

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-provision-user`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` exists with status `active`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin submits a request to provision user `U1` via the AM API.
2. AM invokes the IdP integration contract's user-provisioning operation with tenant scope `T1`.
3. IdP creates user `U1` and binds the user to tenant `T1`.

**Postconditions**:
- User `U1` exists in the IdP
- User `U1` is bound to tenant `T1` via the tenant identity attribute

**Alternative Flows**:
- **IdP unavailable**: IdP contract call fails or times out. AM returns `idp_unavailable` error to the caller. No user record is created or modified. (See `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-deterministic-errors`.)

#### Scenario: Deprovision User

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-deprovision-user`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

**Preconditions**:
- User `U1` exists in tenant `T1`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin submits a request to deprovision `U1`.
2. AM invokes the IdP integration contract's user-deprovisioning operation.
3. System revokes active sessions for `U1`.

**Postconditions**:
- User `U1` is removed or deactivated according to IdP behavior
- Active sessions for `U1` are revoked

**Alternative Flows**:
- **IdP unavailable**: IdP contract call fails or times out. AM returns `idp_unavailable` error to the caller. User `U1` remains in its current state. (See `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-deterministic-errors`.)

#### Scenario: Query Users by Tenant

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-query-users-by-tenant`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-idp`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` has users `[U1, U2, U3]`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin queries users of `T1`.
2. AM invokes the IdP integration contract's tenant-scoped user-query operation with a tenant filter for `T1`.
3. IdP returns the matching users.

**Postconditions**:
- Response contains `[U1, U2, U3]`
- Returned users are scoped to tenant `T1`

**Alternative Flows**:
- **IdP unavailable**: IdP contract call fails or times out. AM returns `idp_unavailable` error to the caller. (See `cpt-cf-account-management-fr-deterministic-errors`.)

### 8.6 Extensible Tenant Metadata

#### Scenario: Register and Write Tenant Metadata

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-write-tenant-metadata`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`, `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-gts-registry`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` exists with status `active`
- A branding metadata schema is registered with `inheritance_policy: inherit`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin submits branding metadata for tenant `T1`.
2. System validates the payload against the registered branding schema.
3. System stores the metadata entry scoped to `T1`.

**Postconditions**:
- Branding metadata is stored for `T1`
- Child tenants without overrides inherit `T1` branding via the resolution API (`inheritance_policy: inherit`)

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Schema validation fails**: Write is rejected with `validation` error
- **Metadata schema not registered**: Write is rejected with `code=not_found` and `sub_code=metadata_schema_not_registered`

#### Scenario: Resolve Inherited Metadata

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-resolve-inherited-metadata`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` has branding metadata stored under a registered inheritable schema
- Child tenant `T2` has no branding metadata of its own

**Main Flow**:
1. Consumer requests the effective branding metadata for tenant `T2`.
2. System finds no `T2`-level entry for that metadata kind.
3. System walks up the hierarchy and finds `T1`'s entry.
4. System returns `T1`'s branding as the effective value for `T2`.

**Postconditions**:
- `T2` receives `T1`'s branding metadata via inheritance
- No metadata entry is created for `T2`

**Alternative Flows**:
- **`T2` has its own entry**: `T2`'s value takes precedence (override)
- **`override_only` schema**: Resolution returns empty — no hierarchy walk

#### Scenario: Write Override-Only Metadata

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-write-override_only-metadata`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- A billing-address metadata schema is registered with `inheritance_policy: override_only`
- Tenant `T2` exists with status `active`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin writes billing-address metadata for `T2`.
2. System validates the payload against the registered billing-address schema.
3. System stores the entry scoped to `T2`.

**Postconditions**:
- `T2` has its own billing-address metadata
- Child tenants of `T2` do not inherit this value (`override_only` policy)

**Alternative Flows**:
- **None**: No additional alternative flows beyond standard validation

#### Scenario: Resolve Metadata Across Multiple Self-Managed Boundaries

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-resolve-metadata-multi-barrier`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Hierarchy: `Root → T1 (self-managed) → T2 → T3 (self-managed) → T4`
- `Root` has branding metadata stored under a registered inheritable schema
- `T3` has a metadata entry for the same branding schema
- `T4` has no branding metadata of its own

**Main Flow**:
1. Consumer requests the effective branding metadata for tenant `T4`.
2. System walks up the hierarchy from `T4` and encounters `T3`'s self-managed barrier.
3. System stops the walk at `T3` (barrier boundary) and returns `T3`'s branding as the effective value.

**Postconditions**:
- `T4` receives `T3`'s branding metadata (nearest ancestor within the same barrier boundary)
- `Root`'s branding is not considered because `T3`'s self-managed barrier stops traversal

**Alternative Flows**:
- **`T3` has no metadata either**: Resolution returns empty — the walk stops at the barrier and does not cross into `T1`'s scope

#### Scenario: List Metadata Entries of a Tenant

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-list-tenant-metadata`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` exists with status `active`
- `T1` has stored branding and billing-address metadata entries
- No entry exists for any other schema on `T1`

**Main Flow**:
1. Tenant admin requests the list of metadata entries written directly on `T1`.
2. System returns the two stored entries, each with its metadata kind, payload, and audit timestamps.
3. Pagination metadata is included consistent with other AM list APIs.

**Postconditions**:
- Response contains exactly the two entries actually stored on `T1`
- Inherited values (from ancestors) are **not** included — inheritance is observable only through the metadata-resolution capability

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Tenant has no metadata yet**: Response is an empty page, not an error
- **Caller lacks the `list` action on resource type `Metadata`**: Request is rejected with `cross_tenant_denied` / authorization error per the deterministic error contract

#### Scenario: Distinguish Unregistered Schema From Missing Entry

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-metadata-schema-vs-entry-not-found`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` exists with status `active`
- The intended branding metadata schema is registered
- `T1` has no entry for that schema yet
- A misspelled metadata schema identifier is not registered in GTS

**Main Flow**:
1. Client requests a metadata entry using the misspelled schema identifier.
2. System returns `not_found` with `sub_code=metadata_schema_not_registered`.
3. Client corrects the identifier to the registered branding schema and retries the same lookup.
4. System returns `not_found` with `sub_code=metadata_entry_not_found`.

**Postconditions**:
- Client can branch on the sub-code: the typo case is a client/configuration bug; the second case is a normal "unset" state and triggers a write to populate the entry.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Client uses the resolution capability**: The same sub-code distinction applies there as well — typos return `metadata_schema_not_registered`, while a registered but empty chain returns the standard empty-resolution response, not `not_found`.

#### Scenario: Per-Schema Permission Denial

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-account-management-usecase-metadata-permission-denied-per-schema`

**Actor**: `cpt-cf-account-management-actor-tenant-admin`

**Preconditions**:
- Tenant `T1` exists with status `active`
- Both branding and billing-address metadata schemas are registered
- Policy grants actor the `write` action on resource type `Metadata` scoped to `T1` only for the branding schema kind

**Main Flow**:
1. Actor writes a branding payload to `T1` — request is authorized and stored.
2. Actor writes a billing-address payload to `T1` — request is rejected with the authorization error, not a validation error, because policy does not grant `Metadata.write` for that metadata kind.

**Postconditions**:
- Only the branding entry exists on `T1`
- Auditable trail shows the billing-address attempt was denied at the authorization layer with the metadata kind carried in the decision context

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Read variant**: The same policy shape restricts `Metadata.read` / `Metadata.list` per-`schema_id`; list responses omit entries the actor is not permitted to read.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Initial root tenant is automatically created during platform installation and linked to IdP; bootstrap is idempotent and does not create a duplicate root on restart or upgrade.
- [ ] Bootstrap waits for IdP readiness before completing the initial root-tenant creation path, retries with backoff while the IdP is unavailable, and fails cleanly after the configured timeout.
- [ ] Root tenant is undeletable; any deletion attempt against the root tenant fails with the deterministic root-protection validation error, preserving exactly one root tenant per deployment.
- [ ] Child tenants can be created with GTS-enforced type constraints; depth advisory threshold emits an operator-visible warning signal, strict mode rejects when enabled.
- [ ] Authorized administrators can read tenant details and update mutable tenant fields; immutable hierarchy-defining fields are rejected by the general update operation.
- [ ] Managed tenants do not create visibility barriers and remain eligible for delegated parent administration under platform authorization policy; self-managed tenants block default parent access via visibility barriers.
- [ ] Any post-creation toggle of a tenant's `self_managed` flag (in either direction) goes through a dual-consent `ConversionRequest`: one side initiates from its own authorized scope, the counterparty resolves from its own scope within the configured approval window (default 72h). The target mode is always derived by AM from current tenant state.
- [ ] Creation-time declaration of self-managed mode does not require a `ConversionRequest`; the parent actor's explicit act of creating the tenant in that mode is the required consent.
- [ ] Tenant creation is intentionally non-idempotent: a clean compensated `idp_unavailable` failure may be retried, while ambiguous transport failures, timeouts, and generic platform faults require reconciliation before retry.
- [ ] Direct children queries return paginated results with status filtering.
- [ ] IdP user operations (provision, deprovision, query) work through pluggable IdP integration contract.
- [ ] User deprovisioning is idempotent: deleting an already-absent IdP user returns success while a missing tenant still returns `not_found`.
- [ ] AM module initialization registers or verifies the chained Resource Group user-group type schema `gts.x.core.rg.type.v1~x.core.am.user_group.v1~`, including `allowed_memberships = [gts.x.core.am.user.v1~]` and self-referential `allowed_parents`, before user-group operations are relied upon.
- [ ] User groups (delegated to Resource Group) support creation, membership management, and nested groups with cycle detection via Resource Group forest invariants.
- [ ] Extensible tenant metadata (e.g., branding, contacts, billing-address) is configurable per tenant via GTS-registered schemas, with per-schema inheritance policy, exposed via tenant metadata resolution API.
- [ ] Tenant metadata entries written directly on a tenant are discoverable via a dedicated listing endpoint with pagination; listing honors self-managed barriers the same way other tenant-scoped reads do.
- [ ] Authorization policy can restrict `read`, `write`, `delete`, and `list` actions on resource type `Metadata` at `schema_id` granularity; `PolicyEnforcer` receives `schema_id` as a resource attribute on every metadata operation.
- [ ] `not_found` errors on metadata endpoints carry the stable sub-codes `metadata_schema_not_registered` and `metadata_entry_not_found`.
- [ ] Tenant isolation is verified by automated security tests: Tenant A cannot access Tenant B data through any path.
- [ ] Tenant context validation completes in p95 ≤ 5ms.
- [ ] All tenant configuration changes are recorded in the platform append-only audit infrastructure with actor and tenant identity, including `actor=system` events for AM-owned background transitions.
- [ ] All failures map to deterministic error categories.
- [ ] AM exports the documented domain-specific metrics for dependency health, metadata resolution, bootstrap lifecycle, tenant-retention work, conversion lifecycle, hierarchy-depth threshold exceedance, and cross-tenant denials.
- [ ] Concurrent mode conversion requests targeting the same tenant produce deterministic outcomes: duplicate initiation is rejected with the deterministic pending-request conflict response, and AM preserves the invariant that only one pending request can exist per tenant at a time.
- [ ] Conversion request lifecycle has four distinct resolved statuses: `approved` (counterparty consents), `cancelled` (initiator withdraws), `rejected` (counterparty declines), `expired` (approval window elapsed). Each is a terminal state carried in `status` — not collapsed into audit metadata.
- [ ] Wrong-side attempts on a pending conversion request (e.g., initiator tries to approve or reject; counterparty tries to cancel) fail with the deterministic invalid-actor conflict response, and the returned error detail is sufficient for clients to disambiguate the rejected transition.
- [ ] Resolved conversion requests (`approved`/`cancelled`/`rejected`/`expired`) are retained for the configured window (default 30 days) and then soft-deleted; default queries exclude soft-deleted rows.
- [ ] Metadata resolution returns the correct value when multiple self-managed boundaries exist in the ancestor chain.
- [ ] Hard-deletion background job correctly processes leaf-first ordering when parent and child share the same retention window.
- [ ] IdP timeout during user provisioning results in deterministic rollback with `idp_unavailable` error.
- [ ] Parent Tenant Administrator can list conversion requests for direct children through the dedicated parent-scope discovery capability without barrier bypass; only conversion-request metadata needed for review and resolution is exposed.
- [ ] Initiator can withdraw a pending conversion request from their own scope, counterparty can decline it from their own scope, and neither side can drive the other's transition.

## 10. Dependencies

**AM depends on:**

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| IdP Provider (via IdP integration contract) | User authentication, token issuance, user-tenant binding. IdP must be available before AM bootstrap completes. | p1 |
| GTS Types Registry | Provides runtime-extensible tenant type definitions and parent-child constraint validation at tenant creation time. | p1 |
| [Resource Group](../../resource-group/docs/PRD.md) | User group hierarchy, membership storage, cycle detection, tenant-scoped isolation, and the ownership-graph data AM reads to verify that no tenant-owned resource associations remain before soft deletion. | p1 |

**Depend on AM (consumers):**

| Consumer | What it consumes |
|----------|-----------------|
| Tenant Resolver Plugin | Syncs denormalized hierarchy projection from AM source-of-truth tenant tables. |
| AuthZ Resolver Plugin | Consumes tenant hierarchy and barrier state for authorization decisions. |
| RBAC Engine | Consumes user group structure and membership data from Resource Group for group-to-role binding; uses AM tenant hierarchy and barrier context separately where needed. |
| Billing System | Consumes tenant hierarchy metadata with barrier bypass for billing aggregation. |

## 11. Assumptions

- IdP is a pluggable component accessed via the IdP integration contract. The platform ships a default implementation; deployments can substitute vendor-specific providers behind the same contract.
- Initial root tenant is created during platform install; IdP is bootstrapped by infrastructure before AM starts. The initial Platform Administrator identity is provisioned in the IdP as part of infrastructure setup — AM links the root tenant to this pre-existing identity but does not create the admin user itself.
- User provisioning follows an API-only invite model; no self-registration is supported.
- Parent-child tenant creation is governed by GTS type constraints (allowed-parents rules); extensible by registering new GTS type schemas without code changes.
- The v1 tenant-mode contract is binary: `managed` and `self-managed`. Richer barrier taxonomies are explicitly out of scope for this review baseline.
- RBAC Engine handles role definitions, role assignments, and group-to-role binding; Resource Group provides group structure and membership data, while AM provides tenant hierarchy, barrier context, and IdP-backed user lookup when needed.
- Resource ownership is represented in the Resource Group ownership graph; tenant deletion validation relies on the absence of resource associations under the tenant's ownership scope.
- Authorization enforcement (AuthZ Resolver) and barrier-aware traversal (Tenant Resolver) are external consumers of AM source-of-truth data; their projection consistency and query performance are their own responsibility.

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| Cross-tenant data leak due to query-level isolation bypass | Low | High | Tenant data exposure, contractual and legal liability | Automated security test suite with cross-tenant access attempts; barrier enforcement at query level; continuous monitoring |
| Tenant hierarchy depth exceeding practical limits at scale | Low | Medium | Performance degradation of hierarchy queries and projections | Configurable advisory threshold (default: 10) with opt-in strict mode; monitoring of hierarchy depth distribution; design for scalability beyond 10,000 tenants |
| Circular nesting in user groups | Low | Low | Infinite loops in permission resolution | Enforced by Resource Group forest invariants — cycle detection at group move/create time; consumers receive `CycleDetected` directly from Resource Group before persistence. AM is not in the call path. |
| IdP provider unavailability during operations | Medium | High | Tenant creation and user lifecycle operations become temporarily unavailable | Clear deterministic error mapping (`idp_unavailable`), bootstrap retry/backoff, and operator alerting via observability metrics |
| Ambiguous retry after tenant-create timeout or generic platform fault | Medium | Medium | Blind retry of tenant creation can trigger duplicate tenant or IdP-side provisioning attempts because the initial outcome may already have crossed the IdP boundary | Document tenant creation as intentionally non-idempotent; require reconciliation before retry; use platform audit records, compensation metrics, and reaper cleanup for investigation |

## 13. Review Baseline Decisions

The following decisions are fixed for the review-ready v1 baseline:

- **Barrier model**: v1 standardizes a binary `self_managed` barrier contract across AM, Tenant Resolver, and AuthZ Resolver.
- **User reassignment**: moving a user between tenants remains a v1 non-goal because it requires cross-platform coordination beyond the IdP contract.
- **Approved deployment profile**: 100K tenants, 300K users (IdP-stored), 30K user groups / 300K memberships (RG-stored), and 1K rps peak.
- **Authoritative detailed artifacts**: REST wire contract authority is [account-management-v1.yaml](./account-management-v1.yaml); reference storage schema authority is [migration.sql](./migration.sql).

## 14. Open Questions

- **Do we need managed-tenant impersonation in v1?** The current review-ready baseline does not commit AM to issuing impersonation tokens or exposing a stable impersonation endpoint. If v1 requires that capability, PRD, DESIGN, OpenAPI, AuthZ vocabulary, IdP contract, and security/test scope must be updated together as one coordinated contract change.

## 15. Traceability

- **Upstream requirements**: No UPSTREAM_REQS document exists for account-management. AM requirements are derived directly from platform architecture needs and business use cases documented in this PRD.
- **Downstream artifacts**: AM-specific [DESIGN](./DESIGN.md) exists. `DECOMPOSITION` and `FEATURE` artifacts are intentionally not part of this review-readiness pass, so downstream implementation traceability remains an accepted open gap.
- **Canonical platform references**:
  - [Authorization DESIGN](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/DESIGN.md) — authoritative source for `SecurityContext`, AuthN/AuthZ separation, and request-path enforcement
  - [Security Overview](../../../../docs/security/SECURITY.md) — inherited platform security, audit, and defense-in-depth controls
  - [ModKit Unified System](../../../../docs/modkit_unified_system/README.md) — inherited runtime, migration, and rolling-upgrade conventions
  - [Tenant Model](../../../../docs/arch/authorization/TENANT_MODEL.md) — platform-wide tenant terminology and ownership semantics
  - [Tenant Resolver README](../../tenant-resolver/README.md) — current resolver traversal and barrier behavior consumed by downstream authorization components
