## 1. Overview

**Purpose**: Chat Engine is a proxy service that manages session lifecycle and message routing between clients and external webhook backends.

Chat Engine provides a unified interface for building conversational applications by abstracting session management, message history persistence, and flexible message processing. The system acts as an intermediary layer that handles the complexity of session state, message tree structures, and backend integration, allowing application developers to focus on building user experiences and webhook backend developers to focus on message processing logic.

The core value proposition is enabling flexible, stateful conversation management with support for advanced features like message regeneration and conversation branching. By decoupling the conversation infrastructure from processing logic, Chat Engine enables rapid experimentation with different AI models, processing backends, and conversation patterns without requiring changes to client applications.

The system supports various conversation patterns including traditional linear chat and branching conversations with variant exploration. This flexibility enables use cases ranging from AI-powered assistants to human-in-the-loop support systems.

**Target Users**:
- **Application Developers** - Build chat applications using Chat Engine as backend infrastructure for session and message management
- **Webhook Backend Developers** - Implement custom message processing logic (AI, rule-based, human-in-the-loop) that integrates with Chat Engine
- **End Users** (indirect) - Use applications built on Chat Engine, experiencing responsive conversational interfaces

**Key Problems Solved**:
- **Session Management Complexity**: Eliminates the need for each application to implement session lifecycle, message history persistence, and state management from scratch
- **Message Routing Flexibility**: Decouples message processing logic from infrastructure, enabling easy switching between different backends (AI models, custom logic, human operators)
- **Conversation Variants**: Provides built-in support for message regeneration and branching conversations, enabling users to explore alternative responses without losing conversation history
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Allows seamless switching between different message processing backends mid-conversation, enabling hybrid approaches like starting with AI and escalating to human support

**Success Criteria**:
- Message routing latency < 100ms (p95) excluding backend processing time
- 99.9% uptime for session management operations
- Support for 10,000 concurrent sessions per instance
- Zero message loss during backend failures
- First message response time < 200ms from session creation

**Capabilities**:
- Session lifecycle management (create, delete, retrieve)
- Message routing to webhook backends with real-time streaming
- Message variant preservation (regeneration, branching)
- File attachment references in messages
- Session type switching mid-conversation
- Session export (JSON, Markdown, TXT)
- Session sharing via links with read-only and branching access
- Message search within sessions and across sessions
- Message tree navigation and variant selection

## 3. Functional Requirements

#### FR-001: Create Session

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-create-session`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: High

The system must create a new session with a specified session type and client ID. The system notifies the webhook backend of the new session and receives available capabilities for that session type. The capabilities determine which features are enabled (file attachments, session switching, summarization, etc.).

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-002: Send Message with Streaming Response

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-send-message`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: High

The system must forward user messages to webhook backend with full session context (session metadata, capabilities, message history) and stream responses back to client in real-time. The system persists the complete message exchange (user message and assistant response) after streaming completes.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-003: Attach Files to Messages

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-attach-files`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: High

The system must support file references in messages. Client uploads files to external storage, receives file URLs, and includes them in message payloads. The system forwards file URLs to webhook backends as part of message context. File handling is enabled only if session capabilities allow it.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-file-storage`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-004: Switch Session Type

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-switch-session-type`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Medium

The system must allow switching to a different session type mid-session. When switching occurs, the next message is routed to the new webhook backend with full message history. The new backend returns updated capabilities which apply for subsequent messages.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-005: Recreate Assistant Response

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-recreate-response`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: High

The system must allow regeneration of assistant responses. When recreation is requested, the old response is preserved as a variant in the message tree, and a new response is generated and stored as a sibling (same parent, different branch). Both variants remain accessible for navigation.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-006: Branch from Message

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-branch-message`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Medium

The system must allow creating new messages from any point in conversation history, creating alternative conversation paths. When branching, the system loads context up to the specified parent message and forwards the new message to the backend with truncated history. Both conversation branches remain preserved.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-007: Navigate Message Variants

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-navigate-variants`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Medium

The system must allow navigation between message variants (siblings with same parent message). When retrieving messages, the system provides variant position information (e.g., "2 of 3") and allows clients to request specific variants.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-008: Stop Streaming Response

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-stop-streaming`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: High

The system must allow canceling streaming responses mid-generation. When cancellation occurs, the system stops forwarding data from webhook backend, closes the connection, and saves the partial response as an incomplete message with appropriate metadata.

The system must export sessions in JSON, Markdown, or TXT format. Export can include only the active conversation path or all message variants. The system uploads the formatted export to file storage and returns a download URL.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-010: Share Session

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-share-session`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Low

The system must generate shareable links for sessions. Recipients can view sessions in read-only mode and create branches from the last message in the session. Branches created by recipients do not affect the original session owner's conversation path.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-end-user`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-011: Session Summary

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-session-summary`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Medium

The system must support session summarization if enabled by session type capabilities. Summary generation is triggered automatically or on demand and can be handled by the webhook backend or a dedicated summarization service. The summary is stored as session metadata.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-012: Search Session History

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-search-session`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Low

The system must search within a single session's message history and return matching messages with surrounding context. Search supports text matching across all message roles (user and assistant).

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-013: Search Across Sessions

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-search-sessions`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: Low

The system must search across all sessions belonging to a client and return ranked results with session metadata (session ID, title, timestamp, match context). Results are ordered by relevance.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### FR-014: Delete Session

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-fr-delete-session`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**Priority**: High

The system must delete sessions and all associated messages. Before deletion, the system notifies the webhook backend to allow cleanup of backend-specific resources. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

**Actors**: `fdd-chat-engine-actor-client`, `fdd-chat-engine-actor-webhook-backend`
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### NFR-004: Data Persistence

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-nfr-data-persistence`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
All messages must be persisted to database before sending acknowledgment to client. Zero message loss is required during system failures, network interruptions, or backend failures. Database writes must use ACID transactions to ensure consistency.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### NFR-005: Streaming Performance

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-nfr-streaming`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Streaming latency overhead (time between receiving chunk from backend and forwarding to client) must be less than 10ms at p95. First byte of streamed response must arrive at client within 200ms of backend starting to stream. Streaming must support backpressure to handle slow clients.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### NFR-006: Authentication

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-nfr-authentication`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
System must authenticate all client requests using secure authentication mechanisms. Session access must be restricted to authorized clients (session owner or share token holders). Client IDs must be validated on every request.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### NFR-007: Data Integrity

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-nfr-data-integrity`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Message tree structure must maintain referential integrity at all times. Orphaned messages (messages with non-existent parent) are not allowed. Parent-child relationships must be immutable once created. Database constraints must enforce tree structure integrity.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### NFR-008: Backend Isolation

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-nfr-backend-isolation`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Webhook backend failures must not affect other sessions using different backends. Request timeout must be configurable per session type with a default of 30 seconds. Backend errors must be isolated and logged without cascading to other system components.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->

## 6. Additional Context

#### Integration with Webhook Backends

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-prd-context-webhook-integration`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Webhook backends are expected to be HTTP services that receive session context (session metadata, capabilities, message history) and return responses. Backends are responsible for all message processing logic, enabling flexible implementations including AI chat (LLMs), rule-based systems, human-in-the-loop support, or hybrid approaches. The webhook contract is designed to be backend-agnostic, allowing easy experimentation with different processing approaches.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Message Tree Structure

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-prd-context-message-tree`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Messages form a tree structure where each message (except the root) references a parent message. This tree structure enables conversation branching and message variant preservation. Multiple sibling messages with the same parent represent variants (alternative responses). The client application is responsible for rendering the tree structure in UI and providing navigation controls. The system maintains tree integrity but does not enforce a specific UI representation.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Message Visibility Control

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-prd-context-message-visibility`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Messages can be selectively hidden from users or LLMs using visibility flags:

- **`is_hidden_from_user`** (boolean): When true, the message is excluded from client-facing APIs and UI rendering. The message remains in the database and message tree but is not returned to clients. Use cases include system prompts, backend configuration messages, and internal tracking notes.

- **`is_hidden_from_llm`** (boolean): When true, the message is excluded from the context history sent to webhook backends during message processing. The message is still visible to users (unless also hidden via `is_hidden_from_user`) but does not influence LLM responses. Use cases include user feedback, debug messages, and messages that should not affect conversation context.

These flags enable flexible message handling patterns:
- **System prompts**: `is_hidden_from_user=true, is_hidden_from_llm=false` - Configure LLM behavior without showing configuration to users
- **Internal notes**: `is_hidden_from_user=true, is_hidden_from_llm=true` - Store metadata or debug information without affecting UI or LLM
- **User feedback**: `is_hidden_from_user=false, is_hidden_from_llm=true` - Show user messages in UI but exclude from LLM context (e.g., rating messages)
- **Normal messages**: `is_hidden_from_user=false, is_hidden_from_llm=false` - Standard visible messages that are part of conversation flow
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Assumptions

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-prd-context-assumptions`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Key assumptions underlying this PRD:
- Webhook backends are always HTTP-accessible from Chat Engine instances
- Client applications handle all UI rendering of message trees and conversation visualization
- File storage service provides signed URL access with configurable expiration
- Database service supports ACID transactions and can handle write loads from concurrent sessions
- Network between Chat Engine and webhook backends is reliable (same region/VPC preferred)
- Client applications handle user authentication and pass validated client IDs to Chat Engine
- Webhook backends have reasonable response times (<30 seconds for most operations)
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-prd-context-non-goals`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
The following are explicitly out of scope for Chat Engine:
- Message content processing, analysis, or moderation (handled by webhook backends)
- User authentication and identity management (handled by client applications)
- File upload/download implementation (handled by external file storage service)
- UI rendering and conversation visualization (handled by client applications)
- Rate limiting per user or organization (handled by client applications or API gateway)
- Billing, usage tracking, and quota management (separate service)
- Real-time collaboration features (multiple users in same session)
- Message encryption at rest (delegated to database service)
- Content delivery network (CDN) integration for file serving
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Risks

**ID**: `fdd-chat-engine-prd-context-risks`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Identified risks and mitigation strategies:
- **Webhook Backend Latency**: Slow backends directly impact user experience. Mitigation: configurable timeouts per session type, monitoring and alerting for slow backends, consider caching for idempotent operations.
- **Database Contention**: High message volume may cause database write contention and slow queries. Mitigation: read replicas for query operations, connection pooling, query optimization, consider sharding by client ID.
- **Message Tree Complexity**: Deep branching (many variants or deep trees) may impact query performance and UI rendering. Mitigation: implement depth limits, pagination for variant navigation, database indexing on parent relationships.
- **File Storage Costs**: Unrestricted file attachments may lead to high storage costs. Mitigation: enforce file size limits, implement retention policies, consider compression for certain file types.
- **Session Abandonment**: Large numbers of inactive sessions may consume database resources. Mitigation: implement session cleanup policies, archive old sessions, monitor active session metrics.
