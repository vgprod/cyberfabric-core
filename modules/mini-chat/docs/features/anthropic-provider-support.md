# Feature: Anthropic Model Support

## 1. Feature Context

### 1.1 Overview

Add Anthropic Claude model support to mini-chat, enabling both Microsoft Foundry and Anthropic platform as LLM backends. Achieves feature parity with existing OpenAI providers: text streaming, native tools (web_search, code_execution), function calling, images, file access, and RAG.

### 1.2 Key Decisions

1. **One adapter, two platforms** — Microsoft Foundry and Anthropic Platform both use native Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`). One `AnthropicMessagesProvider` serves both — the difference is only base URL and auth.

2. **Tool loop inside adapter** — Custom tool calls (`search_files`, `load_files`) are handled inside the adapter, invisible to `StreamService` and turn architecture. 1 turn = 1 `ProviderStream` regardless of internal LLM calls.

3. **Files API on both platforms (beta)** — Both Microsoft Foundry and Anthropic Platform support Files API in beta. Confirmed in [Anthropic overview: Files and Assets](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/overview#files-and-assets) (as of March 2026). This enables `load_files` tool, `document`, `image`, and `container_upload` blocks on both platforms.

4. **Model is immutable per chat** — `chat.model` is set at creation and cannot change (`cpt-cf-mini-chat-constraint-model-locked-per-chat`). This means: if a chat uses an Anthropic model, all files in that chat are for Anthropic. No model-switching scenarios to handle.

5. **Eager upload to both backends (Anthropic model chats only)** — Files always go to Azure/OpenAI (file store + vector store). When the chat model is Anthropic, also upload to Anthropic Files API **in parallel** — `anthropic_file_id` is set immediately. For OpenAI model chats, only the Azure/OpenAI upload happens (existing behavior, unchanged). Azure/OpenAI is the primary store: if it fails, the entire upload fails regardless of Anthropic result. If only the Anthropic upload fails, the file upload succeeds (`anthropic_status=failed`), but `load_files` will return an error for that file. This is possible because the chat model is immutable (decision #4).

6. **All files accessed via `load_files` tool** — Files (documents and images) are never included in requests automatically. Claude calls `load_files` when it needs file content. The adapter determines the correct content block type (`document`, `image`, or `container_upload`) based on attachment metadata.

7. **Usage: sum all tokens** — Tool loop sums all token fields across internal LLM calls. Matches what Anthropic bills us and maintains parity with OpenAI (where retrieved chunks are baked into `input_tokens`).

### 1.3 Why Custom Tools + OpenAI/Azure Backend for RAG

Mini-chat's existing RAG flow delegates everything to the LLM provider: file upload → vector store creation → `file_search` tool → provider performs retrieval internally. OpenAI and Azure provide the full stack: file storage, embedding, vector indexing, and retrieval.

Anthropic **does not provide** this RAG infrastructure:

- **No vector store / search API** — no `/v1/vector_stores`, no server-side indexing or retrieval.
- **No `file_search` tool** — no native ability to search uploaded documents.
- **No embedding API** — [explicitly recommends](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/embeddings) third-party services (as of March 2026).
- **Files API is limited to content access** — [Files API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/files) (beta, March 2026) allows file upload and referencing in messages, but provides no vector search or embedding.

Given these constraints, file access is split into two custom tools:

- **`search_files`** — semantic search via Azure/OpenAI vector store (`POST /v1/vector_stores/{vs_id}/search`)
- **`load_files`** — full file access via Anthropic Files API (`document` / `image` / `container_upload` blocks)

### 1.4 Two Classes of File Tasks

| Class | Examples | Mechanism | Tool |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| **Full file context** | "Summarize file", "Translate document", "Build chart from CSV", "Describe this image" | Anthropic Files API → `document` / `image` / `container_upload` | `load_files` |
| **Semantic search** | "What does the report say about revenue?", "Find risk mentions" | Azure/OpenAI vector store → scored chunks | `search_files` |

**Why both tools exist:**
- `search_files` is cheaper (only relevant chunks as input tokens) and scales to many files
- `load_files` gives complete content but is expensive (full file = input tokens) and limited by request size (32MB)
- Claude chooses the appropriate tool based on the user's request

### 1.5 Scope

| Capability | OpenAI (current) | Anthropic (this feature) |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Text streaming | Native SSE | Native Anthropic SSE |
| Web search | Native tool | Native `web_search_20260209` (server-side) |
| Code execution | Native `code_interpreter` | Native `code_execution_20250825` (server-side) |
| Function calling | Native | Native `tool_use` (Anthropic format) |
| File search / RAG | Native `file_search` (server-side) | Custom `search_files` tool loop via Azure vector store |
| Full file access | Native (file_id in request) | Custom `load_files` tool → Files API → `document`/`image`/`container_upload` |
| Images | file_id in request (auto-included) | `load_files` tool → Files API → `image` block |
| Code execution + files | file_id in request | `load_files` → `container_upload` in sandbox |

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Provider Adapter

New `AnthropicMessagesProvider` implementing the existing `LlmProvider` trait, following the same pattern as `OpenAiResponsesProvider`.

**Key decision: All tool loops live inside the adapter**, not in `StreamService`.

Rationale:
- `LlmProvider::stream()` returns `ProviderStream` yielding `ClientSseEvent` items. Tool loops are an implementation detail of the Anthropic adapter.
- From `StreamService`'s perspective, Anthropic tools look identical to OpenAI's native tools: `Tool { Start }`, `Tool { Done }`, then text deltas.
- Zero changes to `StreamService`, `ProviderStream`, `LlmProvider` trait, or existing providers.

### 2.2 Turn Architecture Compatibility

The tool loop is **completely transparent** to the turn layer.

- 1 turn = 1 user message + 1 streaming task → 1 `ProviderStream` → 1 finalization
- `ProviderStream` abstracts internal LLM calls — turn layer sees a single stream of `ClientSseEvent` items
- `accumulated_text` collects deltas from ALL internal calls
- `Usage` is summed across all calls (see §6.1)
- Finalization receives one `accumulated_text`, one `Usage`, one `response_id`

**Edit/Replay works unchanged:**
- Edit: soft-delete old turn + user message → new turn → new `run_stream()` → adapter re-executes tool loop from scratch
- Retry: same flow, reuses original user content
- Snapshot boundary ensures deterministic context (same attachments, same vector store)

**Vector store search call tracking:**
- Adapter emits `ClientSseEvent::Tool { phase: Start/Done, name: "file_search" }` for each search
- `StreamService` counts `Done` events → `file_search_completed_count` (same pattern as `web_search_completed_count`)
- Passed to `FinalizationInput` → `UsageEvent.file_search_calls`

### 2.3 Two Platform Support

| Platform | Base URL | Auth Header | API Path |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Anthropic Platform | `api.anthropic.com` | `x-api-key: {key}` | `/v1/messages` |
| Microsoft Foundry | `{resource}.services.ai.azure.com` | `api-key: {key}` or Entra ID Bearer | `/anthropic/v1/messages` |

Same adapter, different YAML config entries. OAGW handles routing via upstream aliases.

**Microsoft Foundry specifics:**
- Supported regions: East US2, Sweden Central
- Subscriptions: Enterprise and MCA-E only
- Known SSE bug: occasional concatenated events without proper `\n\n` delimiter

### 2.4 Anthropic Messages API Format

#### Key differences from OpenAI

| Aspect | OpenAI | Anthropic |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| System prompt | Message with `role: "system"` | Top-level `system` field (content block array) |
| Message content | String or array | Always content block array: `[{ type: "text", text }]` |
| Tool calls | Separate `tool_calls` array on assistant message | Content blocks with `type: "tool_use"` in `content` array |
| Tool results | Message with `role: "tool"` | Content blocks with `type: "tool_result"` in user message |
| Stop reasons | `stop`, `length`, `tool_calls`, `content_filter` | `end_turn`, `tool_use`, `max_tokens`, `stop_sequence` |
| Usage fields | `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens` | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` |
| Streaming events | `data: {chunk}` + `data: [DONE]` | Named events: `message_start`, `content_block_delta`, etc. |
| Max tokens | Optional | **Required** (`max_tokens` field) |

#### SSE Event Flow

```
event: message_start       → Skip (capture message ID, input_tokens)
event: content_block_start → Start tracking block (text/tool_use/server_tool)
event: content_block_delta → Delta { text } or accumulate tool input JSON
event: content_block_stop  → Finalize block
event: message_delta       → Capture stop_reason + output token usage
event: message_stop        → Terminal(Completed/Incomplete) or enter tool loop
```

#### Event Translation to `TranslatedEvent`

| Anthropic Event | Condition | → TranslatedEvent |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `message_start` | always | `Skip` (capture message ID, input_tokens) |
| `content_block_start` | `type: "text"` | `Skip` (start text block tracking) |
| `content_block_start` | `type: "tool_use"` | `Skip` (start accumulating tool input JSON) |
| `content_block_start` | `type: "server_tool_use"`, name starts with `web_search` | `Sse(Tool { Start, "web_search" })` |
| `content_block_start` | `type: "server_tool_use"`, name starts with `code_execution` | `Sse(Tool { Start, "code_execution" })` |
| `content_block_delta` | `type: "text_delta"` | `Sse(Delta { "text", content })` |
| `content_block_delta` | `type: "input_json_delta"` | `Skip` (append to accumulated tool input) |
| `content_block_stop` | after web_search block | `Sse(Tool { Done, "web_search" })` |
| `content_block_stop` | after code_execution block | `Sse(Tool { Done, "code_execution" })` |
| `content_block_stop` | after text/tool_use block | `Skip` |
| `message_delta` | `stop_reason: "end_turn"` | `Skip` (prepare Completed) |
| `message_delta` | `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` | `Skip` (prepare Incomplete) |
| `message_delta` | `stop_reason: "tool_use"` | `Skip` (trigger tool loop) |
| `message_stop` | after `end_turn` | `Terminal(Completed)` |
| `message_stop` | after `max_tokens` | `Terminal(Incomplete)` |
| `message_stop` | after `tool_use` | **Do not emit Terminal** — enter tool loop |
| `error` | always | `Terminal(Failed)` |
| `ping` | always | `Skip` |

## 3. Custom Tool: `search_files`

### 3.1 Purpose

Semantic search over uploaded documents via Azure/OpenAI vector store. Used when Claude needs to find specific information across files (vs reading the whole file).

**Why custom tool:** Anthropic has no native `file_search`, no vector store API, no embedding API.

### 3.2 Tool Definition

Configurable via provider config (see §5.4). Default:

```json
{
  "name": "search_files",
  "description": "Search the user's uploaded files for relevant information. Call this tool when the user asks about specific content in their uploaded documents.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "A natural language search query describing the information to find."
      }
    },
    "required": ["query"]
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Tool Loop Flow

```
Claude → search_files({ query: "quarterly revenue" })
  ↓ stop_reason: "tool_use"
Adapter:
  ├─ Emit Tool { Start, "file_search" }
  ├─ POST /v1/vector_stores/{vs_id}/search { query, max_num_results, filters }
  │   → Azure/OpenAI returns scored chunks
  ├─ Emit Tool { Done, "file_search" }
  ├─ Build continuation request with tool_result (formatted chunks)
  └─ Send second request to Claude → stream final response
```

### 3.4 VectorStoreSearchClient

**New file:** `infra/llm/providers/vector_store_search.rs`

URI by `StorageKind`:
- OpenAI: `/{alias}/v1/vector_stores/{vs_id}/search`
- Azure: `/{alias}/openai/vector_stores/{vs_id}/search?api-version={ver}`

Reuses `RagHttpClient::json_post()`.

### 3.5 Search Result Formatting

```
[Source: report.pdf (relevance: 0.95)]
Q3 revenue was $12.5M, up 15% YoY...

[Source: summary.docx (relevance: 0.82)]
Annual revenue projections show...
```

---

## 4. Custom Tool: `load_files`

### 4.1 Purpose

Load files (documents and images) into the conversation so Claude can see their content or process them with code execution. All file types — documents, images, spreadsheets — go through this single tool.

**Why a tool (not auto-include):**
- File content costs input tokens (full file tokenized by Anthropic). Auto-including all files on every request would be expensive.
- Claude decides **when** files are needed based on the user's request. "hello" → no files loaded. "summarize the attached file" → Claude calls `load_files`.

**Why `load_files` with Files API content blocks:**
- `document`/`image`/`container_upload` are native Anthropic content types — Claude processes them natively
- `container_upload` gives code execution sandbox access
- No manual text/binary encoding in tool_result needed

### 4.2 Tool Definition

```json
{
  "name": "load_files",
  "description": "Load files to see their content or process with code.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "filenames": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["report.pdf", "data.csv", "photo.png"]
        },
        "description": "Names of files to load."
      }
    },
    "required": ["filenames"]
  }
}
```

**Dynamic enum:** The `filenames` enum is built at request time from the chat's attachments (all kinds — documents and images). If duplicate filenames exist, a display suffix is added: `report.pdf`, `report (2).pdf`. This deduplication is only in the tool definition — filenames in the DB and storage are unchanged.

**In-memory filename mapping:** The adapter loads all chat attachments at the start of the request and builds a `HashMap<String, Attachment>` mapping display names to attachment records. When Claude returns `filenames: ["report (2).pdf"]`, the adapter resolves the display name to the attachment via this map and reads `anthropic_file_id` directly — no additional DB query needed. The map is transient and lives only for the duration of the request.

**No `mode` parameter.** The adapter determines the content block type automatically from attachment metadata:

| `attachment_kind` | `for_code_interpreter` | code_execution tool in request | → Content block |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Image` | — | — | `image` |
| `Document` | `true` | yes | `container_upload` |
| `Document` | any | no / `false` | `document` |

### 4.3 Tool Loop Flow

```
Claude → load_files({ filenames: ["report.pdf", "data.csv", "photo.png"] })
  ↓ stop_reason: "tool_use"
Adapter:
  ├─ Emit Tool { Start, "file_load" }
  ├─ Resolve filenames → attachments via filename map
  ├─ For each attachment: look up anthropic_file_id (already set at upload time)
  ├─ Emit Tool { Done, "file_load" }
  ├─ Build continuation request with:
  │   ├─ tool_result { content: "Files loaded: report.pdf, data.csv, photo.png" }
  │   ├─ document block for report.pdf
  │   ├─ container_upload block for data.csv (for_code_interpreter + code_execution in tools)
  │   └─ image block for photo.png
  └─ Send second request → Claude sees all files → stream response
```

### 4.4 Continuation Request with File Blocks

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        { "type": "tool_use", "id": "toolu_abc", "name": "load_files",
          "input": { "filenames": ["report.pdf", "data.csv", "photo.png"] } }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_abc",
          "content": "Files loaded: report.pdf, data.csv, photo.png" },
        { "type": "document", "source": { "type": "file", "file_id": "file_011C..." },
          "title": "report.pdf" },
        { "type": "container_upload", "file_id": "file_022D..." },
        { "type": "image", "source": { "type": "file", "file_id": "file_033E..." } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.5 Beta Header

All requests using Files API require: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`

## 6. Multi-Turn Tool Loop Mechanics

### 6.1 Usage Accumulation

Each Anthropic API response includes its own `usage`. The adapter **sums ALL fields** across tool loop iterations:

| Field | Rule | Rationale |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `input_tokens` | **Sum** | Anthropic bills per-request; user pays the same. Matches OpenAI parity (retrieved chunks included in input_tokens). |
| `output_tokens` | **Sum** | Each iteration generates new output |
| `cache_read_input_tokens` | **Sum** | Total cache hits. **Not included** in `input_tokens` — separate field. |
| `cache_creation_input_tokens` | **Sum** | Total cache writes. **Not included** in `input_tokens` — separate field. |

**Example:**

| Request | input_tokens | output_tokens |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 1st (→ tool_use) | 500 | 50 |
| 2nd (with tool_result/file) | 800 | 200 |
| **Reported to finalization** | **1300** | **250** |

**Cache tokens and credits:** In Anthropic's API, `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` are **separate from** `input_tokens`. This differs from OpenAI, where cached tokens are included in `input_tokens`. Total actual input = `input_tokens` + `cache_read_input_tokens` + `cache_creation_input_tokens`.

The credits formula (`credits_micro_checked`) uses only `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`. For OpenAI this is correct — cached tokens are already included. For Anthropic, the adapter must **normalize** before passing to finalization: sum `input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens` into the `input_tokens` field of `Usage`. This ensures the credits formula sees the same total regardless of provider. The raw cache breakdown is preserved separately for observability (see §6.1 table).

Anthropic bills cache_read at ~0.1x and cache_creation at ~1.25x of normal input price — applying these differential rates to credits is a separate concern (see open question #2).

### 6.2 State Machine

```rust
enum ToolLoopPhase { Streaming, ExecutingTool, Continuing, Done }
```

```
Streaming → (stop_reason: "end_turn") → Done [Terminal(Completed)]
Streaming → (stop_reason: "max_tokens") → Done [Terminal(Incomplete)]
Streaming → (stop_reason: "tool_use") → ExecutingTool
ExecutingTool → (tool executed) → Continuing
Continuing → Streaming [new SSE stream from continuation request]
```

Cap at `max_tool_calls` iterations (already on `LlmRequest`).

### 6.3 Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Vector store search fails | `tool_result { is_error: true }`, Claude continues without context |
| File download/upload fails | `tool_result { is_error: true }`, Claude continues without file |
| Continuation request fails | `Terminal(Failed)` with accumulated partial content and accumulated usage (see below) |
| Cancellation during tool execution | Check `cancel.is_cancelled()`, stop yielding events — CAS finalizer handles as `Cancelled` → billing ABORTED |
| Max iterations reached | Force `tool_result` with error, Claude responds with available context |

**Partial tool loop failure — usage for settlement:** When a continuation request fails at iteration N, the adapter has accumulated usage from iterations 1..N-1 (and possibly partial usage from iteration N's `message_start`). This accumulated usage constitutes "actual provider usage" for settlement purposes — `settlement_method="actual"` with the summed tokens. The adapter MUST pass the accumulated `Usage` to finalization regardless of which iteration failed. Do not fall back to the estimated formula or discard completed iterations' usage.

### 6.4 Prompt Caching

Add `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` to system prompt and tool definitions. On continuation, cached content costs ~10% of normal input price. Only new content (tool_use + tool_result + file) incurs full cost.

### 6.5 Quota Reserve and Tool Loop Overshoot

**Known limitation:** Quota reserve is computed once at preflight (§5.4) from `ContextPlan + max_output_tokens`. Each tool loop iteration re-sends the full conversation context plus new content (tool_result, file blocks). With N iterations, cumulative `input_tokens` can significantly exceed the single-call reserve estimate.

**Comparison with OpenAI:** For OpenAI, `file_search` is server-side — one API call, chunks baked into `input_tokens`. For Anthropic, N custom tool iterations means N API calls with context re-send.

**Mitigating factors:**

1. **Prompt caching (§6.4)** — on iterations 2+, the bulk of re-sent context hits the cache (~10% cost). Financial overshoot is much smaller than raw token count suggests.
2. **Typical depth is 1–2 iterations** — `search_files` → response or `load_files` → response. Chains hitting `max_tool_calls` are rare.
3. **Overshoot tolerance (§5.8.1)** — the main design already handles reserve overruns; completed turns are not retroactively cancelled.

**Operator tuning:** `tool_surcharge_tokens` (§5.5.6) can be configured per-model to account for multi-iteration overhead. Operators deploying Anthropic models should set a higher `tool_surcharge_tokens` than for OpenAI to absorb the expected overshoot.

**P2: precise reserve formula.** A more accurate reserve accounting for `max_tool_calls` multiplier and cache hit rates is deferred to P2. The current approach (single-call reserve + overshoot tolerance + operator tuning) is sufficient for P1.

## 7. Configuration

### 7.1 Anthropic Platform

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    kind: anthropic_messages
    host: "api.anthropic.com"
    api_path: "/v1/messages"
    rag_provider: "azure_openai"
    auth_plugin_type: "gts.x.core.oagw.auth_plugin.v1~x.core.oagw.apikey.v1"
    auth_config:
      header: "x-api-key"
      prefix: ""
      secret_ref: "cred://anthropic-key"
```

### 7.2 Microsoft Foundry

```yaml
providers:
  azure_anthropic:
    kind: anthropic_messages
    host: "${AZURE_FOUNDRY_HOST}"
    api_path: "/anthropic/v1/messages"
    rag_provider: "azure_openai"
    auth_plugin_type: "gts.x.core.oagw.auth_plugin.v1~x.core.oagw.apikey.v1"
    auth_config:
      header: "api-key"
      prefix: ""
      secret_ref: "cred://azure-foundry-key"
```

### 7.3 Storage Backend (existing, shared)

```yaml
providers:
  azure_openai:
    kind: openai_responses
    host: "myinstance.openai.azure.com"
    storage_kind: azure
    api_version: "2025-03-01-preview"
    auth_plugin_type: "gts.x.core.oagw.auth_plugin.v1~x.core.oagw.apikey.v1"
    auth_config:
      header: "api-key"
      prefix: ""
      secret_ref: "cred://azure-openai-key"
```

### 7.4 Custom Tool Configuration

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    # ...
    search_files_tool:
      name: "search_files"
      description: "Search the user's uploaded files for relevant information."
      query_description: "A natural language search query."
      max_num_results: 10
      score_threshold: 0.5

    load_files_tool:
      name: "load_files"
      description: "Load files to see their content or process with code."
```

**`search_files_tool` parameters:**
- `name` — tool name exposed to Claude (default: `search_files`)
- `description` — tool description guiding when Claude calls it
- `query_description` — description of the `query` parameter
- `max_num_results` — max chunks returned from vector search (default: 10)
- `score_threshold` — minimum relevance score to include (default: 0.5, range 0.0–1.0)

**`load_files_tool` parameters:**
- `name` — tool name exposed to Claude (default: `load_files`)
- `description` — tool description guiding when Claude calls it

**Note:** The `filenames` enum is built dynamically by the adapter at request time from the chat's attachments (documents + images). Content block type (`document` / `image` / `container_upload`) is determined automatically by the adapter from attachment metadata — Claude does not choose it.

### 7.5 RAG Provider Separation

**Problem:** Currently `provider_id` from `ResolvedModel` is used for both LLM calls and storage operations (file upload, vector store). For OpenAI providers this works — one provider does everything. For Anthropic it breaks: `provider_id: "anthropic"` has no file storage or vector store API.

**Current flow (OpenAI):**
```
resolve_model() → provider_id: "azure_openai"
  → LLM: proxy to azure_openai upstream ✓
  → File upload: DispatchingFileStorage routes by "azure_openai" ✓
  → Vector store: DispatchingVectorStore routes by "azure_openai" ✓
  → storage_backend label: resolve_storage_backend("azure_openai") → "azure" ✓
```

**Problem with Anthropic:**
```
resolve_model() → provider_id: "anthropic"
  → LLM: proxy to anthropic upstream ✓
  → File upload: DispatchingFileStorage routes by "anthropic" ✗ (no file storage)
  → Vector store: DispatchingVectorStore routes by "anthropic" ✗ (no vector store)
```

**Solution:** New field `rag_provider: Option<String>` on `ProviderEntry`. When set, storage operations (file upload, vector store, cleanup) use this provider instead of the LLM provider.

```rust
// config.rs — new field on ProviderEntry
/// Provider ID for RAG operations (file storage and vector store).
/// When set, file upload / vector store / search / cleanup use this
/// provider's OAGW upstream and auth instead of the LLM provider's.
/// Required for providers that don't offer file storage (e.g., Anthropic).
#[serde(default)]
pub rag_provider: Option<String>,
```

**Updated flow (Anthropic):**
```
resolve_model() → provider_id: "anthropic"
  → config: rag_provider = Some("azure_openai")
  → LLM: proxy to "anthropic" upstream (Anthropic Messages API)
  → File upload: DispatchingFileStorage routes by "azure_openai" ✓
  → Vector store: DispatchingVectorStore routes by "azure_openai" ✓
  → storage_backend label: resolve_storage_backend("azure_openai") → "azure" ✓
  → Anthropic Files API: adapter uses "anthropic" upstream directly
```

**Changes required:**
1. `ProviderEntry` — add `rag_provider: Option<String>` field
2. `ProviderResolver` — add `resolve_rag_provider(provider_id) -> &str` method that returns `rag_provider` if set, otherwise `provider_id` itself (backward compatible)
3. `AttachmentService::resolve_model_limits()` — use `resolve_rag_provider()` instead of raw `provider_id` for storage operations
4. `DispatchingFileStorage` / `DispatchingVectorStore` — route by resolved storage provider
5. `resolve_storage_backend()` — resolve from storage provider entry, not LLM provider entry
6. Validation at startup — if `rag_provider` references a non-existent provider, fail fast

## 8. File Upload Flow

### 8.0 Upload Strategy

**Model is immutable per chat** (`cpt-cf-mini-chat-constraint-model-locked-per-chat`). If the chat uses an Anthropic model, we know this at file upload time and can upload to Anthropic Files API immediately.

**Rule:** Files always go to Azure/OpenAI (file store + vector store). If the chat model is Anthropic, also upload to Anthropic Files API **in parallel**.

```
User uploads file (chat model = Anthropic)
    ↓
AttachmentService::upload_file()
    ├─ Upload to Azure/OpenAI Files API → provider_file_id          [EXISTING]
    ├─ Add to vector store (if document) → vector_store_id           [EXISTING]
    └─ Upload to Anthropic Files API → anthropic_file_id             [NEW, parallel]
```

For OpenAI model chats, only Azure/OpenAI upload happens (existing behavior, unchanged).

**Why eager parallel upload:**
- **Model is immutable** (`cpt-cf-mini-chat-constraint-model-locked-per-chat`) — no risk of wasted uploads. If the chat is Anthropic, files will always be for Anthropic.
- **Zero latency at `load_files` time** — `anthropic_file_id` is ready when Claude needs it.
- **Azure/OpenAI as primary file store** — Anthropic Files API is still in beta. Azure/OpenAI is the stable backend. Anthropic file_id is a derived cache that can be re-created from Azure/OpenAI if needed.

**Failure policy:**

| Azure/OpenAI | Anthropic | Overall result |
|---|---|---|
| OK | OK | `status=ready`, `anthropic_status=uploaded` — happy path |
| OK | Failed | `status=ready`, `anthropic_status=failed` — RAG works (`search_files`), but `load_files` returns error for this file |
| Failed | OK | `status=failed` — whole upload failed. Azure/OpenAI is the primary store; without it there's no vector store and no `search_files`. Orphaned Anthropic file cleaned up by cleanup worker |
| Failed | Failed | `status=failed`, `anthropic_status=failed` — whole upload failed |

**Rule: Azure/OpenAI is the primary store.** If it fails, the entire upload fails regardless of Anthropic result.

When `anthropic_status=failed`: `load_files` returns an error `tool_result` for that file — Claude tells the user the file is unavailable. The user can re-upload. Log the failure at `warn!` level.

### 8.0.1 Streaming & Memory Considerations

**Parallel upload to Anthropic** reuses the same file bytes already buffered by `RagHttpClient::multipart_upload()` from the client HTTP request. The `Bytes` type uses reference counting, so `.clone()` is a cheap `Arc::clone` — no second full-buffer copy. Peak memory remains ~1x file size (collected once in `rag_http_client`), not 2x.

The oagw-sdk `Part::stream(name, BodyStream)` is fully implemented for streaming multipart upload if needed in the future. The comment in `rag_http_client.rs` (lines 38-40) about "OAGW chunked encoding issues" blocking `Part::stream` is outdated — streaming infrastructure is fully tested in `oagw-sdk/src/multipart.rs`.

### 8.1 Database Schema Changes

#### 8.1.1 `attachments` table — new column

```sql
-- PostgreSQL
ALTER TABLE attachments
  ADD COLUMN anthropic_file_id VARCHAR(128),
  ADD COLUMN anthropic_status VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'not_attempted'
    CHECK (anthropic_status IN ('not_attempted', 'pending', 'uploaded', 'failed'));

-- SQLite
ALTER TABLE attachments
  ADD COLUMN anthropic_file_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE attachments
  ADD COLUMN anthropic_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'not_attempted'
    CHECK (anthropic_status IN ('not_attempted', 'pending', 'uploaded', 'failed'));
```

New fields on entity:

```rust
// infra/db/entity/attachment.rs
#[sea_orm(column_type = "String(StringLen::N(128))", nullable)]
pub anthropic_file_id: Option<String>,

#[sea_orm(column_type = "String(StringLen::N(16))")]
pub anthropic_status: AnthropicUploadStatus,
```

```rust
/// Anthropic Files API upload status.
/// Lifecycle: not_attempted → pending → uploaded | failed.
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, EnumIter, DeriveActiveEnum)]
#[sea_orm(rs_type = "String", db_type = "String(StringLen::N(16))")]
pub enum AnthropicUploadStatus {
    /// OpenAI model chat, or pre-migration row — never attempted upload.
    #[sea_orm(string_value = "not_attempted")]
    NotAttempted,
    /// Upload started but not yet completed. If seen after restart, eligible for retry.
    #[sea_orm(string_value = "pending")]
    Pending,
    /// Successfully uploaded — anthropic_file_id is set.
    #[sea_orm(string_value = "uploaded")]
    Uploaded,
    /// Upload failed — anthropic_file_id is NULL.
    #[sea_orm(string_value = "failed")]
    Failed,
}
```

**Field semantics:**

| `anthropic_status` | `anthropic_file_id` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `not_attempted` | `NULL` | OpenAI model chat, or pre-migration row |
| `pending` | `NULL` | Upload in progress (or server crashed mid-upload — eligible for retry) |
| `uploaded` | `"file_011C..."` | Ready for `load_files` |
| `failed` | `NULL` | Parallel upload failed — `load_files` returns error |

- No index needed — lookup is always by primary key (`id`) or by `(chat_id, tenant_id)`
- `not_attempted` is the default, safe for existing rows after migration

**No changes to existing columns.** The `provider_file_id` field continues to store Azure/OpenAI file reference. The new columns are independent, provider-specific state.

#### 8.1.2 `chat_vector_stores` table — no changes

The vector store table is not affected. Vector stores remain in Azure/OpenAI and are referenced by the existing `vector_store_id` field. The `search_files` tool loop uses the same vector store infrastructure.

#### 8.1.3 Migration

New migration file: `m20260327_000001_add_anthropic_fields.rs`

```rust
#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl MigrationTrait for Migration {
    async fn up(&self, manager: &SchemaManager) -> Result<(), DbErr> {
        let stmts = match manager.get_database_backend() {
            sea_orm::DatabaseBackend::Postgres => vec![
                "ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN anthropic_file_id VARCHAR(128)",
                "ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN anthropic_status VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'not_attempted' CHECK (anthropic_status IN ('not_attempted', 'pending', 'uploaded', 'failed'))",
            ],
            sea_orm::DatabaseBackend::Sqlite => vec![
                "ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN anthropic_file_id TEXT",
                "ALTER TABLE attachments ADD COLUMN anthropic_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'not_attempted' CHECK (anthropic_status IN ('not_attempted', 'pending', 'uploaded', 'failed'))",
            ],
            _ => return Err(DbErr::Custom("unsupported backend".into())),
        };
        for sql in stmts {
            manager.get_connection().execute_unprepared(sql).await?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    async fn down(&self, manager: &SchemaManager) -> Result<(), DbErr> {
        // SQLite does not support DROP COLUMN before 3.35.0
        for sql in [
            "ALTER TABLE attachments DROP COLUMN anthropic_status",
            "ALTER TABLE attachments DROP COLUMN anthropic_file_id",
        ] {
            manager.get_connection().execute_unprepared(sql).await?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### 8.1.4 Cleanup considerations

When an attachment is deleted (soft-delete via `deleted_at`), the Anthropic file should also be cleaned up. The existing cleanup worker (`cleanup_worker`) handles provider file deletion — extend it to also call `DELETE /v1/files/{anthropic_file_id}` on the Anthropic Files API when `anthropic_file_id` is present.

## 9. Billing & Usage

### 9.1 Token Billing

Sum ALL fields across tool loop iterations (§6.1). Credit calculation unchanged — same formula with per-model multipliers.

### 9.2 Tool Call Tracking

Add `file_search_calls: u32` with `#[serde(default)]` to `UsageEvent`. Count `Tool { Done, "file_search" }` events (same pattern as `web_search_completed_count`).

### 9.3 Cost Considerations

| Component | Native file_search (OpenAI) | search_files tool loop (Anthropic) |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Vector store search | ~$0.008/query | ~$0.008/query (same API) |
| LLM tokens | Single request | Two requests (context re-sent) |

| Component | Native file access (OpenAI) | load_files tool loop (Anthropic) |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| File read | file_id in request (free) | Files API upload + document block |
| LLM tokens | File tokens in input | File tokens in input (same) |

Prompt caching mitigates tool loop re-send cost (~10% for cached content).

## 10. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Adapter
- `ProviderKind::AnthropicMessages` + factory
- `anthropic_messages.rs`: SSE parsing, event translation, request building
- Both `stream()` and `complete()` implementations (`complete()` used for thread/doc summaries)
- Native tools: `web_search_20260209`, `code_execution_20250825`
- `anthropic-version` header, `rag_provider` config field
- OAGW provisioning verification

### Phase 2: Files API + Parallel Upload
- `AnthropicFilesClient`: upload to Anthropic Files API
- Parallel upload in `AttachmentService`: Azure/OpenAI + Anthropic for Anthropic model chats
- `anthropic_file_id` field on attachment entity + migration
- Beta header handling

### Phase 3: search_files Tool Loop
- `VectorStoreSearchClient` (reuses `RagHttpClient`)
- Tool loop state machine in adapter
- Configurable tool description/params
- `LlmRequest` storage context fields

### Phase 4: load_files Tool
- Tool definition with dynamic `filenames` enum from chat attachments
- Content block type resolution from attachment metadata (document/image/container_upload)
- Inject content blocks in continuation request
- Integration with code_execution

### Phase 5: SDK & Billing
- `file_search_calls` in `UsageEvent`
- Tracking in `stream_service` + finalization pass-through

### Phase 6: Testing
- Unit: request building, event translation, tool loops, image handling
- Tool loops: search_files, load_files (mock OAGW + Files API)
- Integration: provider resolver, config deserialization

### Phase 7: Observability
- Metrics: `provider_id` labels, `file_search_tool_loop_latency_ms`, `load_files_latency_ms`
- Logging: tool loop iterations at `debug!` (query, result count, latency)
- Error sanitization: Anthropic `msg_` response IDs

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Tool loop stream complexity | High dev effort | `async_stream::stream!` macro for generator-style impl |
| OAGW stripping `anthropic-version` header | Requests rejected | Adapter adds per-request via `proxy_request()` |

| Files API beta instability | Breaking changes | Azure/OpenAI is primary store; Anthropic Files API is a re-populatable cache |
| Claude not calling tools appropriately | Wrong tool for task | Configurable tool descriptions + system prompt guards |
| Microsoft Foundry Files API availability | `load_files` broken on Microsoft Foundry | [Official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude?tabs=python#call-the-claude-messages-api) confirm Files API is supported. Monitor for beta changes. |

## 13. Open Questions

1. **Extended Thinking** — Parse and ignore for now, or expose to users? Thinking tokens are billed as output tokens by Anthropic — the billing path must handle them from day one regardless of UI exposure decision. Ensure `output_tokens` in `Usage` includes thinking tokens.
2. **Prompt caching differential billing** — Anthropic bills cache_read at ~0.1x and cache_creation at ~1.25x of normal input price. The adapter normalizes cache tokens into `input_tokens` for credits (see §6.1), so total token count is correct. But credits are charged at the flat `input_mult` rate — no discount for cache hits, no surcharge for cache writes. If we want accurate cost attribution, the credits formula needs cache-specific multipliers. Not blocking for Phase 1.
3. **Rate limiting** — Anthropic 429 handling: OAGW retry sufficient or adapter-level backoff?
4. **Microsoft Foundry SSE bug** — Resilient parser or fail fast?
5. **Files API stability** — Beta on both platforms. How to handle breaking changes?
6. **Model catalog** — How to configure Claude models in policy catalog (provider_id, multipliers, tool support flags)?
7. **Storage context plumbing for tool loops** — The adapter needs vector_store_ids, attachment metadata, and OAGW gateway reference for `search_files` / `load_files` tool execution. `LlmRequest` currently has no storage-related fields. Options: (a) add storage context fields to `LlmRequest` + builder, (b) pass a separate `ToolLoopContext` alongside `LlmRequest` in `LlmProvider::stream()`, (c) inject storage context at adapter construction time (adapter becomes stateful per-request). Needs design decision before Phase 3.
8. **Lazy re-upload on `load_files`** — Currently, when `anthropic_status=failed`, the file is unavailable for `load_files` (user must re-upload). A future improvement: at `load_files` time, if `anthropic_status=failed`, download from Azure/OpenAI store and re-upload to Anthropic Files API. On success, update `anthropic_status=uploaded` + set `anthropic_file_id`. Trade-off: adds latency to the tool loop (download + upload mid-stream) and complexity, but improves resilience against transient Anthropic Files API failures. Would also be required if model-switching per chat is added in the future (decision #4 currently prohibits this).
9. **`anthropic_file_id` / `anthropic_status` column scalability** — Dedicated columns work for one provider. If a third provider (e.g., Google Gemini) needs the same pattern, refactor to an `attachment_provider_files` join table with `(attachment_id, provider, file_id, status)` instead of adding per-provider columns.

---

## 14. Verification

1. `cargo test -p cf-mini-chat` — all new tests pass
2. `make dev-clippy && make dev-fmt`
3. **E2E Anthropic Platform:** text streaming → web_search → upload file → search_files → load_files → code_execution with file → images
4. **E2E Microsoft Foundry:** same flow (Files API beta)
5. **Billing:** verify `UsageEvent` token counts and `file_search_calls` across tool loop iterations
