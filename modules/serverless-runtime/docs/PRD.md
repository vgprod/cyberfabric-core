## 1. Overview

### Purpose

<!-- cpt:paragraph:purpose -->
Provide a platform capability that enables tenants and their users to create, modify, register, and execute custom automation (functions and workflows) at runtime, without requiring a product rebuild or redeploy, while maintaining strong isolation, governance, and operational visibility.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:purpose -->

**Target Users**:
<!-- cpt:list:target-users required="true" -->
- Application developers who provide custom functions and workflows for integrations at runtime, isolate orchestration logic, and reduce direct dependencies between services
- Tenant administrators who manage automation assets, schedules, permissions, and governance at the tenant level
- Tenant users who create and manage personal workflow automations within their user scope
- Platform operators who monitor, maintain, and develop the serverless runtime environment and Infrastructure Adapters
<!-- cpt:list:target-users -->

### Background / Problem Statement

<!-- cpt:paragraph:context -->
The platform requires a unified way to automate long-running and multi-step business processes across modules and external systems. Today, automation capability is limited by release cycles and lacks durable, tenant-isolated execution with governance, controls, and observability. This PRD defines the business requirements for a Serverless Runtime capability that is deliberately implementation-agnostic — the requirements can be satisfied by embedded interpreters (e.g., Starlark, WASM), workflow orchestration engines (e.g., Temporal, Cadence), cloud-native FaaS platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda + Step Functions), or other serverless/workflow technologies. The system can optionally support domain-specific languages (DSLs) for workflow/function definition; DSL support is implementation-specific and not required to satisfy these business requirements.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:context -->

**Key Problems Solved**:
<!-- cpt:list:key-problems required="true" -->
- Automation capability is limited by release cycles — tenants cannot deploy custom logic without platform rebuilds
- No unified mechanism for durable, long-running, multi-step business process orchestration across modules and external systems
- Lack of tenant-isolated execution with governance controls, resource limits, and auditability
- Insufficient operational visibility and debugging tools for distributed workflow executions
<!-- cpt:list:key-problems -->

### Goals (Business Outcomes)

**Success Criteria**:
<!-- cpt:list:success-criteria required="true" -->
- Runtime service availability ≥ 99.95% monthly (Baseline: N/A; Target: production launch)
- New execution start latency p95 ≤ 100ms under normal load (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
- Step dispatch latency p95 ≤ 50ms under normal load (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
- Execution visibility query latency p95 ≤ 200ms under normal load (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
- Scheduled executions start within 1 second of scheduled time under normal conditions (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
- Execution completion success ≥ 99.9% (excluding business-logic failures) via retries/compensation (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
- Business continuity: RTO ≤ 30 seconds, RPO ≤ 1 minute for execution state (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
- Audit trails and tenant isolation support SOC 2-aligned controls (Baseline: N/A; Target: v1.0)
<!-- cpt:list:success-criteria -->

**Capabilities**:
<!-- cpt:list:capabilities required="true" -->
- Runtime creation, modification, registration, and execution of functions and workflows without platform rebuild
- Common calling mechanism for functions and workflows via a unified function invocation surface
- Tenant-, application-owner-, and user-scoped registries with isolation, ownership, and access control
- Long-running asynchronous and synchronous execution with durable state persistence, including streaming inputs/outputs
- Multiple trigger modes: schedule-based, API-triggered, event-driven, and internal invocation (helper/extended functions)
- Governance controls via resource limits, quotas, and policies per tenant and per definition
- Host-Worker isolation for secure multi-tenant execution environments
- Rich operational tooling: execution visibility, debugging, audit trails, and observability
- Built-in support for saga/compensation patterns and idempotency mechanisms
- Infrastructure adapter integration with hot-plug registration and hot (re)loading of native modules
- LLM agent integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol) with JSON-RPC 2.0 function invocation, elicitation for human-in-the-loop input, and sampling for LLM-completion-during-execution
<!-- cpt:list:capabilities -->

### Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Workflow** | A durable, resumable process that orchestrates a sequence of steps; maintains state across failures and can run for extended periods (days to years). |
| **Workflow Definition** | A specification of workflow steps, inputs, outputs, error handling logic, and compensation behavior. |
| **Workflow Instance** | A single execution of a workflow definition with specific input parameters and state. |
| **Function** | A single unit of custom logic that can be invoked independently or as part of a workflow. |
| **Callable Base Type** | Unified base type for all callable entities (functions and workflows); a registered definition that can be invoked via the runtime API. Workflows extend this base with additional traits. |
| **Function Definition** | Canonical definition for a function using a GTS-identified JSON Schema with pinned params/returns/errors and traits. |
| **Invocation Mode** | Execution mode for a function: `sync` (caller waits for result), `async` (caller receives an invocation id and polls for status), or `stream` (caller receives server-pushed events/results over SSE). |
| **Compensation** | A rollback action that reverses the effect of previously completed steps when a workflow fails (saga pattern). |
| **Scheduled Workflow** | A workflow that executes on a recurring schedule (periodic/cron-based). |
| **Infrastructure Adapter** | A modular component that integrates external infrastructure (clouds, on-prem systems) and can provide adapter-specific workflow definitions. |
| **Hot-Plug** | The ability to register new workflow/function definitions at runtime without system restart. |
| **Security Context** | Workflow-scoped state containing identity, tenant, and authorization context, preserved throughout workflow execution for communication with platform services. |
| **Execution** | A running or completed instance of a workflow or function, tracked with a unique invocation ID and correlation ID. |
| **Saga Pattern** | A distributed transaction pattern where a long-running workflow is broken into steps, each with a compensating action to undo its effects if the workflow fails. |
| **Tenant Isolation** | Strict separation ensuring one tenant's workflows, executions, and data cannot be accessed by another tenant. |
| **Durable Execution** | Execution that persists state and survives infrastructure failures, allowing workflows to resume from the last completed step. |
| **RTO** | Recovery Time Objective — the maximum acceptable time to restore service after a failure. |
| **RPO** | Recovery Point Objective — the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. |
| **TTL** | Time To Live — the duration for which a cached result remains valid before expiring. |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | A JSON-RPC 2.0-based protocol for exposing callable tools to LLM agents; defines `tools/list` (enumerate available tools with JSON Schema descriptions) and `tools/call` (invoke a tool) operations with SSE streaming, elicitation, and sampling support. |
| **JSON-RPC 2.0** | A lightweight remote procedure call protocol using `{method, params}` request and `{result \| error}` response objects; maps directly onto function invocation without the HTTP resource-centric translation required by REST. |
| **Elicitation** | An MCP protocol capability (`elicitation/create`) that allows a function to pause execution and request human input from the agent client, delivered inline on the active SSE stream. |
| **Sampling** | An MCP protocol capability (`sampling/createMessage`) that allows a function to request an LLM completion from the agent client during execution, enabling model-in-the-loop automation patterns. |
| **LLM Agent** | An AI agent system (such as Claude, GPT, or a LangGraph agent) that uses LLM reasoning to discover and invoke tools via the MCP protocol. |

## Operational Concept & Environment

The Serverless Runtime operates as a module within the CyberFabric modular monolith. It is deployed alongside other platform modules and shares the platform's identity, authorization, event, and observability infrastructure. The runtime executes tenant-provided and adapter-provided functions and workflows within the platform's security boundary.

**Deployment context**: The runtime runs within the CyberFabric server process. Executor implementations (e.g., Starlark) are embedded as native modules. Infrastructure Adapters connect externally and register definitions via hot-plug APIs.

**Operational environment**: Multi-tenant SaaS platform with tenant isolation enforced at the execution, data, and governance layers. Each tenant has independent quotas, policies, and retention settings.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Runtime creation, modification, versioning, and registration of functions and workflows
- Unified function invocation surface: sync/async via REST, and stream mode via JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP protocol surfaces
- Tenant-isolated registry with ownership scoping (user/tenant/system)
- Long-running durable execution with checkpointing and suspend/resume
- Schedule-based, API-triggered, event-driven, and internal invocation triggers
- Configurable retry, compensation, and dead letter handling
- Resource governance (limits, quotas, throttling) per tenant and per definition
- Execution visibility, querying, and lifecycle management
- Input validation and security enforcement
- Audit trail for definition and execution lifecycle events
- Pluggable executor architecture for multiple runtime technologies
- Infrastructure Adapter integration with hot-plug registration

### Out of Scope

- Visual workflow designer UI (future capability)
- External workflow template marketplace
- Real-time event streaming infrastructure (assumed to exist as a separate platform capability)
- Specific access control model selection (RBAC, ReBAC, ABAC) — the runtime provides integration points
- Workflow DSL syntax specification (implementation-specific per executor)

<!-- cpt:##:frs -->
## 3. Functional Requirements

<!-- cpt:###:fr-title repeat="many" -->
### FR-001 Runtime Authoring and Definition Management

<!-- cpt:id:fr has="priority,task" covered_by="DESIGN,DECOMPOSITION,SPEC" -->
- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-runtime-authoring`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system allows tenants and their users to create and modify functions and workflows at runtime, such that changes can be applied without rebuilding or redeploying the platform (BR-001).

The system validates workflow/function definitions before registration and rejects invalid definitions with actionable feedback including: the specific validation error type, the location in the definition (line number, field path, or step identifier), a human-readable error message, and suggested corrections where applicable (BR-011).

The system supports versioning of workflow/function definitions so that new executions can use an updated version, in-flight executions continue with the version they started with, and changes are traceable and can be rolled back where needed (BR-018).

Workflow/function definitions are expressible in a form that allows automated tools (including LLMs) to reliably create, update, validate, and explain the workflow/function behavior in human-readable form (BR-031).

The system supports starting workflows/functions with typed input parameters and receiving typed outputs, such that inputs/outputs can be validated before execution and safely inspected in execution history subject to privacy controls (BR-032).

The system provides a common calling mechanism so that functions and workflows are invoked through a unified function surface, enabling consistent invocation semantics regardless of the underlying runtime implementation.

The system is expected to support hot (re)loading of native modules so that executor implementations and runtime extensions can be updated without platform restart.

### FR-002 Tenant-Isolated Registry and Access Control

<!-- cpt:id:fr has="priority,task" covered_by="DESIGN,DECOMPOSITION,SPEC" -->
- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-tenant-registry`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system provides a registry of functions and workflows per tenant with the following characteristics (BR-002, BR-036):

- Default tenant isolation: workflows and functions MUST be isolated per tenant by default; a tenant MUST NOT see or access another tenant's workflows/functions without explicit sharing
- Ownership scoping: workflows and functions support both tenant-level and user-level ownership; user-scoped definitions are private to the owning user by default, tenant-scoped definitions are visible to authorized users within the tenant
- Access control integration: the system MUST integrate with access control mechanisms to manage who can create, modify, execute, view, and share workflows/functions
- Querying available definitions visible to the requesting actor (based on ownership and sharing policies)
- Filtering by ownership scope (tenant-level or user-level), category, or tags
- Hot-plug registration and deregistration

The system MUST support enabling the workflow/function runtime for a tenant in a way that provisions required isolation and governance settings (including quotas) so the tenant can safely use the capability (BR-020).

**Note**: The specific access control model (RBAC, ReBAC, ABAC, or other) is out of scope for this PRD. The system provides integration points for authorization checks at: definition management, execution start, execution query, execution cancellation, lifecycle operations, and sharing/visibility changes.

### FR-003 Execution Engine and Durability

<!-- cpt:id:fr has="priority,task" covered_by="DESIGN,DECOMPOSITION,SPEC" -->
- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-execution-engine`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system supports long-running asynchronous functions and workflows, including executions lasting days and longer where needed for business processes (BR-003).

The system supports synchronous request/response invocation as a first-class feature for short-running executions, where the caller receives the result (or error) in the same API response. This mode is optional and does not replace long-running asynchronous execution as the primary workload (BR-004).

Workflows provide a mechanism enabling suspend and resume behavior when waiting for events, survival across service restarts, and continuation without losing progress. The system supports suspension periods of at least 30 days. Suspended workflows exceeding the maximum suspension duration (configurable per tenant) are handled according to tenant policy: auto-cancel with notification, indefinite suspension, or escalation (BR-009).

Workflow definitions support conditional branching and loop constructs to model complex business logic (BR-010).

The system supports streaming inputs and outputs for long-running functions, enabling a client or another service to stream data to/from an executing function. Streaming functions are a category of asynchronous execution and are expected to receive an invocation identifier that allows later reference, checkpointing, and reconnection via durable streams.

### FR-004 Trigger and Schedule Management

<!-- cpt:id:fr has="priority,task" covered_by="DESIGN,DECOMPOSITION,SPEC" -->
- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-trigger-schedule`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system supports starting functions/workflows via four trigger modes: schedule-based triggers, API-triggered starts, event-driven triggers, and internal invocation for helper/extended functions (BR-007).

The system supports schedule lifecycle management (create, update, pause/resume, and delete) and supports a configurable policy for handling missed schedules during downtime. The system supports at minimum the following policies: skip (ignore missed execution), catch-up (execute once for all missed instances), and backfill (execute each missed instance individually). The default policy is "skip" (BR-022).

The system supports defining schedule-level input parameters and overrides so that recurring executions can run with consistent defaults and can be adjusted without modifying the underlying definition (BR-110).

### FR-005 Runtime Capabilities and Adapter Integration

<!-- cpt:id:fr has="priority,task" covered_by="DESIGN,DECOMPOSITION,SPEC" -->
- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-runtime-capabilities`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
Workflows and functions are able to invoke runtime-provided capabilities needed for business automation (BR-008):

- Making outbound HTTP requests
- Emitting or publishing business events
- Writing to audit logs
- Invoking platform-provided operations required for orchestration

The system supports runtime registration of workflow/function definitions from Infrastructure Adapters with the following characteristics (BR-035):

- Hot-plug registration without requiring platform restart, including hot reloading of native executor modules
- Per-tenant workflow definition registration; adapters connected to one tenant MUST NOT affect other tenants
- Flexible infrastructure models: adapters can use either per-tenant infrastructure (dedicated resources) or shared infrastructure (multi-tenant resources) based on configuration
- Tenant isolation enforcement: regardless of infrastructure model, tenant isolation MUST be enforced at the execution and data level

When an integration adapter or external dependency is disconnected, the system MUST reject new workflow/function starts that depend on the disconnected component and allow in-flight executions to complete or fail gracefully (BR-136).

### FR-006 Execution Lifecycle and Resilience

<!-- cpt:id:fr has="priority,task" covered_by="DESIGN,DECOMPOSITION,SPEC" -->
- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-execution-lifecycle`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system supports lifecycle management for workflows/functions and their executions, including the ability to: start executions, cancel or terminate executions, retry failed executions, suspend and resume executions, and apply compensation behavior on cancellation where applicable (BR-014).

The system supports configurable retry and failure-handling policies including: maximum retry attempts, backoff behavior, and classification of non-retryable failures (BR-019).

The system provides dead letter handling for executions that repeatedly fail after all retry attempts, ensuring failed executions are preserved for analysis and manual recovery (BR-027).

The system MUST enforce a maximum execution duration guardrail to prevent infinite or runaway executions. This guardrail MUST be configurable per tenant and workflow/function and MUST apply even if higher timeouts are requested (BR-028).

The system MUST ensure that updating a workflow/function definition does not affect executions currently running with the previous version (BR-029).

The system MUST support error boundary mechanisms that contain failures within specific workflow sections and prevent cascading failures across the entire workflow (BR-030).

The system MUST support configurable execution timeouts at both the workflow/function level and individual step level. Configured timeouts MUST NOT exceed the maximum execution duration guardrail (BR-112).

The system MUST monitor and terminate executions that consume excessive resources relative to configured limits, including detection of CPU spinning, memory leaks, and excessive I/O. Terminated executions MUST be logged with detailed resource consumption metrics (BR-040).

The system supports controlled interaction with in-flight executions, including the ability for authorized actors to provide external signals/inputs for event-driven continuation and to perform manual intervention actions needed to resolve operational issues (BR-108).

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system MUST validate all workflow/function inputs against defined schemas before execution begins, including type validation, range and format validation, and detection and rejection of excessive payload sizes. Invalid inputs MUST be rejected with clear error messages (BR-037).

The system MUST prevent injection attacks by ensuring workflow/function inputs cannot be used to execute unintended operations. SQL injection: inputs MUST be parameterized. Command injection: inputs MUST NOT be interpolated into shell commands. Path traversal: file path inputs MUST be validated and restricted to allowed directories. Error messages MUST NOT expose internal system details (BR-038).

The system MUST prevent privilege escalation through input manipulation: inputs that specify or influence execution identity MUST be validated against the caller's authorization scope; inputs requesting elevated permissions MUST be rejected unless explicitly authorized; definitions MUST NOT escalate their own privileges beyond registration-time grants. The system MUST fail if privilege validation cannot be performed (BR-039).

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The platform provides a way to debug workflow executions, including setting breakpoints, logging each action/function call with input parameters and return values, and retaining sufficient execution history to troubleshoot failures (BR-101).

The platform provides step-through capabilities for workflow execution to support troubleshooting and controlled execution (BR-102).

The system supports a dry-run mode for workflows/functions that validates execution readiness (definition validity, permissions, configured limits) using user-provided input. Dry-run does not create a durable execution record and does not cause external side effects (BR-103).

The system provides a debug view for an execution that includes an ordered list of invoked calls with input parameters, execution duration per call, and the exact call response (result or error). The debug view MUST NOT expose secrets; sensitive inputs/outputs MUST be masked by default unless explicitly permitted (BR-130).

The system exposes a standardized error taxonomy for workflow/function execution failures, including upstream HTTP/integration failures, runtime/environment failures (timeouts, resource limits), and code execution and validation failures. Errors include a stable error identifier, a human-readable message, and a structured details object (BR-129).

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-fr-llm-agent-integration`

<!-- cpt:free:fr-summary -->
The system provides a JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint that enables callers to invoke functions using a generalized `{method, params}` request format, removing the REST resource-centric translation overhead for callers that reason in terms of named function calls with typed inputs and outputs. Functions must opt in to JSON-RPC exposure via their definition (BR-209).

The system provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server endpoint that enables LLM agent clients to discover registered functions as MCP tools and invoke them using the `tools/list` and `tools/call` protocol operations. The MCP server uses SSE streaming transport and complies with the MCP specification. Functions must opt in to MCP exposure via their definition (BR-210).

Functions exposed via the MCP server may request human input from the agent client during execution using the MCP elicitation protocol (`elicitation/create`), pausing execution and delivering an elicitation request inline on the active SSE stream. Elicitation capability must be declared in the function definition and requires streaming mode (BR-211).

Functions exposed via the MCP server may request LLM completions from the agent client during execution using the MCP sampling protocol (`sampling/createMessage`), enabling model-in-the-loop automation patterns where the function delegates reasoning steps to the connected LLM. Sampling capability must be declared in the function definition and requires streaming mode (BR-212).

Both the JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP surfaces delegate to the same Invocation Engine as the REST API, ensuring consistent authentication, authorization, quota enforcement, schema validation, and execution lifecycle management across all invocation surfaces.

<!-- cpt:list:exclusions -->
- **Usability / UX** (UX-PRD-001, UX-PRD-002, UX-PRD-003, UX-PRD-004, UX-PRD-005): Not applicable — this is a platform runtime capability, not a user-facing application; consumers interact via APIs and programmatic interfaces, not graphical UIs
- **Visual Workflow Designer UI**: Explicitly out of scope as a future capability; the PRD covers the runtime engine and APIs only
- **External Marketplace**: Explicitly out of scope; sharing is supported via extensible mechanisms (BR-123) but marketplace is not in scope
- **Privacy by Design** (SEC-PRD-005): Not directly applicable at the PRD level — the serverless runtime processes tenant automation logic, not end-user PII; data protection controls (BR-017, BR-025) address sensitive data handling within executions
- **Safety** (SAFE-PRD-001, SAFE-PRD-002): Not applicable — this is a software automation runtime with no physical interaction, medical, or industrial control implications

**Flow**: Multi-Step Resource Provisioning
<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->

<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->
1. Application developer triggers the provisioning workflow via API with typed input parameters (resource type, configuration, tenant context)
2. System validates input against the definition schema and starts an asynchronous execution under system context
3. Workflow provisions the first resource and records the completed step in durable state
4. Workflow provisions subsequent resources sequentially, persisting state after each step
5. If any step fails, the system invokes compensation logic to roll back previously completed steps (saga pattern)
6. On success, system records completion with output results and emits a lifecycle event
<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->
**Postconditions**: All resources are provisioned and confirmed, or all changes are rolled back with compensation steps logged. Execution history is queryable with correlation identifier.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Transient failure**: If a step fails with a retryable error, the system retries according to the configured retry policy (backoff, max attempts) before escalating
- **Service restart during execution**: The workflow resumes from the last completed step without duplicating side effects
- **Compensation failure**: If a compensation step also fails, the execution is moved to the dead letter queue for manual recovery

**Postconditions**: Tenant is fully onboarded with all stages completed. Execution history shows each stage, including suspension/resume events. Security context is preserved throughout the multi-day execution.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Approval timeout**: If the external approval does not arrive within the configured suspension duration, the tenant policy determines the action (auto-cancel with notification, indefinite suspension, or escalation)
- **Credential expiration**: System automatically refreshes the initiator's authentication tokens during the long-running execution to prevent failure due to token expiration

### UC-003 Subscription Lifecycle Management

<!-- cpt:id:usecase -->
**ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-usecase-subscription-lifecycle`

**Actors**:
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->
`cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-tenant-admin`
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->
**Preconditions**: Subscription lifecycle workflows (activation, renewal, suspension, cancellation) are registered and versioned. Tenant has appropriate resource quotas.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->
**Flow**: Subscription Renewal with Schedule
<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->

<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->
1. Tenant administrator creates a schedule-based trigger for the subscription renewal workflow with recurring parameters
2. System validates the schedule configuration and registers it
3. At the scheduled time, system starts a new execution with the schedule-level input parameters
4. Workflow checks subscription status, processes renewal logic, and communicates with billing and notification services
5. System records the execution outcome and captures audit trail entries
<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->
**Postconditions**: Subscription is renewed or appropriately handled. Schedule continues for next cycle. Execution metrics are available for metering and cost allocation.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Missed schedule during downtime**: System applies the configured missed-schedule policy (skip, catch-up, or backfill)
- **Schedule paused**: Administrator pauses the schedule; no new executions are started until resumed
- **Definition updated**: New schedule executions use the updated definition version; in-flight executions continue with the version they started with

### UC-004 Policy Enforcement and Remediation

<!-- cpt:id:usecase -->
**ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-usecase-policy-enforcement`

**Actors**:
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->
`cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-app-developer`, `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-platform-operator`, `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-event-broker`
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->
**Preconditions**: Drift-detection and remediation workflow is registered. Event-driven trigger is configured to fire on policy drift events.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->
**Flow**: Detect Drift and Execute Corrective Actions
<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->

<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->
1. Event infrastructure publishes a policy-drift event
2. System receives the event trigger and starts the remediation workflow under system context
3. Workflow assesses drift severity using conditional branching logic
4. Workflow executes corrective actions (may invoke child workflows for complex remediation)
5. If corrective actions fail, compensation logic rolls back partial changes
6. System logs all actions to the audit trail with tenant and correlation identifiers
<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->
**Postconditions**: Drift is remediated or the execution is preserved in the dead letter queue for manual review. Audit records identify the actor, tenant, and correlation chain.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Resource limit exceeded**: If the workflow exceeds CPU or memory limits, the system terminates it with detailed resource consumption metrics logged
- **Parallel remediation**: If multiple independent remediations are needed, the workflow uses parallel execution with configurable concurrency caps

### UC-005 Adapter Hot-Plug Registration

<!-- cpt:id:usecase -->
**ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-usecase-adapter-hotplug`

**Actors**:
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->
`cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-platform-operator`, `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-infra-adapter`
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->
**Preconditions**: Platform operator has developed an Infrastructure Adapter and connected it to the platform. Target tenant has serverless runtime enabled.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->
**Flow**: Register Adapter Workflows at Runtime
<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->

<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->
1. Platform operator connects the Infrastructure Adapter to the platform for a specific tenant
2. Adapter registers its workflow/function definitions via the hot-plug registration API
3. System validates definitions (schema, input/output types, resource requirements)
4. System registers definitions in the tenant's registry, enforcing tenant isolation
5. Definitions become immediately available for invocation without platform restart
6. System records registration in the audit trail
<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->
**Postconditions**: Adapter-provided workflows/functions are available in the tenant's registry. Existing in-flight executions are unaffected. Definitions are scoped to the connected tenant only.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Validation failure**: If definitions are invalid, the system rejects them with actionable feedback and does not register any definitions from the batch
- **Adapter disconnection**: If the adapter is disconnected, the system rejects new starts for dependent workflows but allows in-flight executions to complete gracefully
- **Definition update**: Adapter registers an updated version; new executions use the new version, in-flight executions continue with the started version

### UC-006 Debugging a Failed Workflow Execution

<!-- cpt:id:usecase -->
**ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-usecase-debug-execution`

**Actors**:
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->
`cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-app-developer`, `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-platform-operator`
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->
**Preconditions**: A workflow execution has failed and is preserved in the dead letter queue or execution history. Operator has appropriate debugging permissions.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->
**Flow**: Investigate and Recover Failed Execution
<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->

<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->
1. Operator queries execution history filtered by status=failed, tenant, and time range
2. Operator inspects the failed execution's debug call trace (ordered calls with inputs, durations, and responses)
3. Operator identifies the failing step and reviews the standardized error taxonomy classification
4. Operator uses step-through or replay capabilities to reproduce the failure in a controlled manner
5. After identifying the root cause, operator triggers a retry of the failed execution or initiates a manual recovery action
<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->
**Postconditions**: Root cause is identified. Execution is either retried successfully or escalated with full debug context. All debugging operations are logged in the audit trail.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Sensitive data in trace**: Secrets and sensitive inputs/outputs are masked by default; operator must have explicit permission to view unmasked values
- **Cross-tenant debugging**: All cross-tenant debugging operations are logged with tenant_id and correlation_id for traceability

### UC-007 Data Migration with Checkpoint/Resume

<!-- cpt:id:usecase -->
**ID**: `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-usecase-data-migration`

**Actors**:
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->
`cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-app-developer`, `cpt-cf-serverless-runtime-actor-tenant-admin`
<!-- cpt:id-ref:actor -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->
**Preconditions**: Data migration workflow is registered with appropriate resource quotas for long-running execution. Source and target data stores are accessible.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:preconditions -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->
**Flow**: Long-Running Data Migration with Durable State
<!-- cpt:paragraph:flow -->

<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->
1. Tenant administrator triggers the data migration workflow with typed input parameters (source, target, batch size, filters)
2. System validates inputs and starts an asynchronous execution
3. Workflow processes data in batches, persisting checkpoint state after each batch
4. If the service restarts mid-migration, the workflow resumes from the last checkpoint without reprocessing completed batches
5. Workflow tracks progress metrics (records processed, errors, duration) available for real-time querying
6. On completion, system records final results and emits lifecycle events
<!-- cpt:numbered-list:flow-steps -->

<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->
**Postconditions**: All data is migrated or the execution is available for retry/resume from the last checkpoint. Execution metrics support cost allocation. Audit trail records the complete migration lifecycle.
<!-- cpt:paragraph:postconditions -->

**Alternative Flows**:
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
- **Permanent failure in a batch**: If a batch fails with a non-retryable error after retry exhaustion, the workflow marks the batch as failed and either continues with remaining batches or halts based on error boundary configuration
- **Max duration guardrail**: If the migration approaches the maximum execution duration, the system checkpoints and allows controlled restart rather than abrupt termination
<!-- cpt:list:alternative-flows -->
<!-- cpt:id:usecase -->
<!-- cpt:###:uc-title repeat="many" -->

<!-- cpt:##:usecases -->


## Acceptance Criteria

**Workflow Execution**:
- Workflows can be started with inputs and produce a completion outcome (success or failure) with a correlation identifier
- In-progress workflows resume after a service restart without duplicating completed step side effects
- Transient failures result in automatic retries per defined policy until success or exhaustion
- Permanent failures in multi-step workflows invoke compensation for previously completed steps
- Workflows can remain active for 30+ days with state preserved and queryable, and can continue on external signals/events

**Tenant Isolation & Security Context**:
- A tenant can only see and manage its own functions/workflows and executions
- Security context is preserved through long-running executions, ensuring actions are attributable to the correct tenant/user or system identity
- Unauthorized operations fail closed

**Hot-Plug / Runtime Updates**:
- New or updated functions/workflows become available without interrupting existing in-flight executions
- Updates do not retroactively change the behavior of already-running executions (safe evolution)

**Scheduling**:
- Tenants can create, update, pause/resume, and cancel schedules for recurring workflows
- Missed schedules during downtime follow a defined policy (e.g., skip or catch-up) and are recorded

**Observability & Operations**:
- Operators can view current execution state, history/timeline, and pending work
- Workflow lifecycle events are captured for audit and compliance
- Operational metrics exist for volume, latency, and error rates, and can be segmented by tenant

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Criticality |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Identity & Authorization** | Authentication and authorization of workflow operations | P0 |
| **Event Infrastructure** | Event bus for delivering event triggers and publishing audit/lifecycle events | P0 |
| **Observability Stack** | Metrics collection, logging, and distributed tracing infrastructure | P0 |
| **Secret Management** | Secret management service for secure storage and injection of sensitive values | P0 |
| **Infrastructure Adapter Contract** | Standard interface specification for adapter integration and hot-plug registration | P0 |


<!-- cpt:##:assumptions -->
## Assumptions

<!-- cpt:list:assumptions -->
- Platform identity and authorization are available and can be used to determine user/system context. If identity service is unavailable, the serverless runtime cannot start new executions.
- Event infrastructure exists to deliver event triggers and record lifecycle events. If event infrastructure is degraded, event-triggered workflows will not start but API-triggered and scheduled workflows continue.
- Persistent storage exists to support durability of execution state. Storage unavailability is a critical dependency that blocks all execution.
- Scheduling is logically part of the Serverless Runtime but may be implemented as a cooperating internal service with its own persistence and scaling characteristics.
<!-- cpt:list:assumptions -->
<!-- cpt:##:assumptions -->


## Risks

<!-- cpt:list:risks -->
- **Workflow logic complexity**: Authoring and governance may be complex for tenants. Mitigation: definition validation with actionable feedback (FR-001), LLM-manageable definitions (BR-031), visualization (FR-012).
- **Hot-plug reliability**: Runtime updates must not destabilize ongoing operations. Mitigation: execution isolation during updates (BR-029), versioning (BR-018), blue-green deployment (BR-121).
- **Security context propagation**: Long-running state must preserve identity reliably. Mitigation: security context availability throughout execution (BR-024), credential refresh (BR-013).
- **Scheduling scale**: Large numbers of schedules may require careful scaling. Mitigation: per-tenant quotas (BR-106), throttling (BR-113), missed schedule policies (BR-022).
- **Noisy neighbor**: Multi-tenant runtime must enforce per-tenant limits to prevent impact. Mitigation: resource governance (BR-005, BR-012), stronger isolation boundaries (BR-206).
- **Sandbox escape / isolation boundary failure**: User-provided code could attempt to break isolation and access host resources or other tenant data. Mitigation: injection prevention (BR-038), privilege escalation prevention (BR-039), resource exhaustion protection (BR-040), stronger isolation (BR-206).
- **Secret exfiltration**: Workflows/functions could attempt to read or emit secrets via outputs, events, HTTP calls, or logs. Mitigation: secure secrets handling (BR-025), debug view masking (BR-130), data protection controls (BR-017).
- **Privilege escalation via execution identity**: Misconfiguration of system/user/API-client execution contexts could grant unintended permissions. Mitigation: privilege escalation prevention (BR-039), access control (BR-016).
