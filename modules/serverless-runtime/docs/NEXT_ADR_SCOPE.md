## 1. Unaddressed PRD Requirements

### P0 Requirements Not Fully Addressed

| PRD ID | Requirement                                | Gap Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Severity    | New |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----|
| BR-006 | Execution identity context                 | No model for selecting execution identity (system / API client / user) per function; `SecurityContext` is passed through but function definitions have no field to declare or constrain which identity the execution runs under; critical for scheduled and event-triggered executions that have no real-time caller | **Blocker** | Yes |
| BR-025 | Secure handling of secrets                 | No `secret_ref` type or secret binding model for workflows to reference secrets                                                                                                                                  | **Blocker** |     |
| BR-030 | Execution error boundaries                 | No error boundary mechanism to contain failures within specific workflow sections and prevent cascading failures; the PRD's mandatory requirement has no corresponding domain concept                                     | **Blocker** | Yes |
| BR-038 | Injection attack prevention                | No input sanitization rules or validation constraints in schema definitions                                                                                                                                      | **Blocker** |     |
| BR-039 | Privilege escalation prevention            | No privilege scope constraints or execution identity validation model                                                                                                                                            | **Blocker** |     |
| BR-008 | Runtime capabilities (HTTP, events, audit) | No SDK/capability interface for workflow authors to invoke platform services                                                                                                                                      | High        |     |
| BR-009 | Durability / suspension policy             | `max_suspension_days` exists on function but PRD requires tenant-level configurable suspension policy with three handling options (auto-cancel with notification, indefinite suspension, escalation); `TenantRuntimePolicy` lacks this; state machine only shows `suspended → failed` on timeout | High        | Yes |
| BR-013 | Long-running credential refresh            | No model for token refresh or credential lifecycle in security context                                                                                                                                           | High        |     |
| BR-017 | Data protection and privacy controls       | No sensitive field annotations, data classification model, or controls for restricting who can view sensitive inputs/outputs in execution history; broader requirement than BR-025 (secrets)                       | High        | Yes |
| BR-023 | Audit log integrity                        | No model for protecting audit records from unauthorized modification/deletion or ensuring availability within configured retention period                                                                          | High        | Yes |
| BR-026 | State consistency                          | No concurrency control or consistency guarantee model for concurrent operations and system failures; checkpointing strategy alone does not address "no partial updates or corrupted states" requirement            | High        | Yes |
| BR-034 | Audit trail for definition changes         | Implementation considerations mention audit but no audit event schema for definition CRUD operations (create, modify, enable/disable, delete) with required tenant/actor/correlation fields                       | High        | Yes |
| BR-040 | Resource exhaustion protection             | Limits defined but no detection/termination model for spinning loops or memory leaks                                                                                                                             | High        |     |
| BR-033 | Encryption controls                        | No encryption-at-rest or in-transit specifications in the domain model; may be infrastructure-level but the ADR should reference the requirement and declare expectations                                          | Medium      | Yes |
