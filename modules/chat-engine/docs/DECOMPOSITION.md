## 1. Overview

The Chat Engine design is decomposed into 10 features organized around functional cohesion. The decomposition follows a strict dependency order: session infrastructure enables plugin system and message processing, which enable all higher-level capabilities.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

- Features grouped by domain cohesion: session lifecycle, plugin system, message core, tree operations, context window, session intelligence, reactions, export, search, and LLM gateway plugin
- Dependencies minimize coupling — each feature is fully implementable given its declared dependencies
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-message-processing` is intentionally shared by features 03–05 because those features extend the message processing pipeline with distinct, independently testable capabilities (tree traversal, context selection, and summarization routing); each sharing is documented in the feature's Scope and Out of Scope sections
- 100% coverage of all 8 DESIGN components, 15 sequences, 7 domain entities, 5 DB tables, 4 principles, and 2 constraints verified
- NFR `nfr-backend-isolation` is shared between Feature 2.2 (Message Processing) and Feature 2.9 (Plugin System): Feature 2.9 defines the plugin trait abstraction, while Feature 2.2 invokes plugins through that trait.
- Feature 2.10 (LLM Gateway Plugin) shares FRs `fr-send-message`, `fr-schema-extensibility`, `fr-session-summary`, `fr-context-overflow`, and `fr-conversation-memory` with other features because it implements the concrete plugin backend for these capabilities.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-webhook-integration` is shared by Features 2.2, 2.9, and 2.10: Feature 2.9 (Plugin System) defines the webhook trait, Feature 2.2 (Message Processing) invokes plugins through it, and Feature 2.10 (LLM Gateway Plugin) implements a concrete plugin.

Feature numbering reflects logical grouping, not implementation order. Recommended implementation sequence: 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.9 → 2.3 → 2.4 → 2.6 → 2.5 → 2.7 → 2.8 → 2.10.

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-streaming`

- **Design Constraints Covered**:

  - None

- **Domain Model Entities**:
  - LlmPluginConfig
  - LlmSummarizationSettings
  - LlmMessageMetadata
  - LlmUsage

- **Design Components**:

  - [ ] `p1` - `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-webhook-integration`

- **API**:
  - No public API — plugin is invoked internally by Chat Engine via trait methods

- **Sequences**:

  - None (uses existing sequences: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-seq-create-session`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-seq-send-message-with-files`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-seq-generate-summary`)

- **Data**:

  - None (uses `cpt-cf-chat-engine-dbtable-plugin-configs` owned by feature-plugin-system; GTS schemas registered at runtime)

## 3. Deliberate Omissions

The following items are intentionally excluded from this decomposition cycle:

- **Monitoring & Alerting infrastructure** — deferred to CyberFabric platform-level observability; Chat Engine emits metrics and structured logs but does not own dashboards or alert rules.
- **Client SDK** — client-side libraries are out of scope for the backend decomposition; API contracts defined in DESIGN.md are sufficient for client teams.
- **Admin UI / Management Console** — session type registration and retention policy configuration are API-only in this cycle.

```

**Dependency Rationale**:

- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-plugin-system` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-session-lifecycle`: plugin configs reference session types; the plugin registry needs the session type infrastructure to resolve `plugin_instance_id`.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-llm-gateway-plugin` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-plugin-system`: implements the `ChatEngineBackendPlugin` trait defined by the plugin system; uses the plugin registry for registration and the `plugin_configs` table for LLM-specific configuration.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-processing` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-session-lifecycle`: messages belong to sessions; the messages table and streaming infrastructure depend on the sessions table and the auth model established in F01.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-variants` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-processing`: variant creation re-invokes the same plugin pipeline and appends to the existing message tree.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-context-management` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-processing`: context selection modifies the plugin payload construction inside the message processing pipeline.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-session-intelligence` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-processing`: summary generation routes through the backend plugin; retention cleanup operates on the messages table.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-session-intelligence` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-reactions`: retention policy enforcement uses `seq-delete-message-cascade` which is owned by Message Reactions.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-reactions` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-processing`: reactions reference message IDs in the messages table; cascade delete operates on the fully populated message tree.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-search` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-message-processing`: the full-text search index is built on the messages table populated by message processing.
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-session-export` requires `cpt-cf-chat-engine-feature-session-lifecycle`: export reads session data from the sessions table and can operate on sessions without messages; share tokens are stored in the sessions table.
- Features `plugin-system` and `message-processing` are independent of each other and can be developed in parallel once `session-lifecycle` is complete.
- Features `message-variants`, `context-management`, `message-reactions`, and `message-search` are independent of each other and can be developed in parallel once `message-processing` is complete. Feature `session-intelligence` also requires `message-processing` but additionally depends on `message-reactions` (for `seq-delete-message-cascade` used in retention enforcement), so it can only start after both are complete.
- Feature `llm-gateway-plugin` can be developed once `plugin-system` is complete; it is independent of message-level features.
- Feature `session-export` is independent of all message-level and plugin features and can be developed in parallel with them.
