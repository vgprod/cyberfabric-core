## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

Chat Engine is designed as a service that decouples conversational infrastructure from message processing logic. The system follows a **hub-and-spoke architecture** where Chat Engine acts as the central hub managing session state, message history, and routing, while Backend Plugin modules serve as spokes implementing custom message processing logic.

The architecture emphasizes **separation of concerns**: Chat Engine handles persistence, routing, and message tree management, while backend plugins focus solely on message processing. This enables flexible experimentation with different backend implementations, processing strategies, and conversation patterns without requiring changes to client applications or infrastructure.

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **Message Tree Structure**: Messages form an immutable tree structure enabling conversation branching and variant preservation
- **Streaming-First**: All plugin responses stream through Chat Engine to clients with minimal latency overhead
- **Plugin-Driven Capabilities**: Session capabilities are provided by backend plugins via `on_session_created()`, not hardcoded in Chat Engine
- **Stateless Routing**: Chat Engine instances can scale horizontally as all session state is persisted in the database
- **Plugin System**: Backend plugins are internal code modules implementing `ChatEngineBackendPlugin` trait; each plugin is referenced by `plugin_instance_id` in session type config (`cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-plugin-backend-integration`)

The system supports both **linear conversations** (traditional chat) and **non-linear conversations** (branching, variants, regeneration), enabling advanced use cases like conversation exploration, A/B testing of different backends, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| FDD ID | Solution Description |
|--------|----------------------|
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-create-session` | RESTful API endpoint creates session record, invokes backend plugin with `session.created` event, stores returned `enabled_capabilities` (typed `Capability[]`) |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-send-message` | HTTP streaming endpoint forwards message to backend plugin, pipes streamed response back to client, persists complete exchange after streaming |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-attach-files` | Messages support file URL array field; client uploads to external storage first, includes URLs in message payload |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-switch-session-type` | Session stores current session_type_id; switching updates this field and routes next message to new backend plugin |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-recreate-response` | Creates new message with same parent_message_id as original, sends `message.recreate` event to backend plugin |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-branch-message` | Client specifies parent_message_id; Chat Engine loads context up to parent, creates new branch in message tree |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-navigate-variants` | Query API returns all messages with same parent_message_id; includes variant position metadata (e.g., "2 of 3") |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-stop-streaming` | Client closes HTTP connection; Chat Engine cancels plugin request, saves partial response with incomplete flag |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-export-session` | Background job traverses message tree (active path or all variants), formats to JSON/Markdown/TXT, uploads to storage |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-share-session` | Generates unique share token stored in database, maps to session_id; recipients create branches from last message |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-session-summary` | Routes `session.summary` event to dedicated summarization service URL or backend plugin based on session type config |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-search-session` | Full-text search on messages table filtered by session_id; returns matches with context window |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-search-sessions` | Full-text search across messages joined with sessions; ranks by relevance, returns session metadata |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-delete-session` | Sends `session.deleted` event to backend plugin, then soft-deletes session and messages in database |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-conversation-memory` | Message history forwarded to backend plugin with configurable depth; visibility flags (`is_hidden_from_backend`) enable context management strategies |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-delete-message` | Hard delete individual messages with cascade reaction cleanup; ownership validation before deletion |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-message-feedback` | UPSERT reaction per user per message; fire-and-forget plugin notification via `message.reaction` event |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-context-overflow` | Session metadata exposes processing metrics; visibility flags and summary primitives enable overflow strategy implementation |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-message-retention` | Background cleanup job enforces per-session-type retention policies; tree-aware deletion preserves active path integrity |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-archive-session` | Session archival sets lifecycle_state=archived; session is retrievable but not active for messaging |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-hard-delete-session` | Permanently removes session, all messages, and all reactions from database; irreversible |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-restore-session` | Restores archived or soft-deleted sessions to active state via lifecycle state machine |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-soft-delete-session` | Marks session lifecycle_state=soft_deleted; preserves data for configurable recovery window |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-retention-policy` | Configurable per-session-type retention policies (age-based or count-based) with scheduled background cleanup |
| `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-schema-extensibility` | Plugin vendors extend domain model schemas (message types, content types, event types) via GTS without modifying Chat Engine core |

### 1.3 Architecture Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Technology |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **API Layer** | HTTP request handling, streaming response coordination, authentication, chunked transfer encoding | HTTP server with async I/O |
| **Application Layer** | Use case orchestration, plugin invocation, streaming coordination | Service classes with dependency injection |
| **Domain Layer** | Business logic, message tree operations, validation rules | Domain entities and value objects |
| **Infrastructure Layer** | Database access, plugin trait dispatch, file storage client | PostgreSQL, HTTP client library (used by plugins), S3 SDK |

#### Technology Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| PostgreSQL full-text search scalability degrades beyond ~10M rows | Search latency increases; may require dedicated search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) | Monitor query latency on `idx_messages_content_fts`; plan migration path to external search service |
| NDJSON streaming through reverse proxies and CDNs may be buffered | Clients experience delayed chunks instead of real-time streaming | Ensure proxy configuration disables response buffering (`X-Accel-Buffering: no`, `proxy_buffering off`) |
| JSONB query performance degrades with deeply nested structures | Slow queries on `content`, `metadata`, and `enabled_capabilities` columns | Limit JSONB nesting depth in GTS schemas; prefer top-level keys for indexed access |
| Single-database architecture limits horizontal write scaling | Write throughput capped by single PostgreSQL instance | Bounded by `cpt-cf-chat-engine-constraint-single-database`; vertical scaling and read replicas as interim measures; sharding by `tenant_id` as future option |

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Principle: Immutable Message Tree

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-immutable-tree`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-tree-structure`

Once a message is created with a parent_message_id, that relationship is immutable. Messages are never moved or re-parented. This ensures referential integrity and enables safe concurrent message creation. Variants are created as siblings (same parent), not by modifying existing messages.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Principle: Backend Plugin Authority

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-backend-authority`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-capability-model`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-plugin-backend-integration`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-llm-gateway-plugin`

Backend plugins are code modules inside Chat Engine implementing the `ChatEngineBackendPlugin` trait. A session type references its plugin via `plugin_instance_id`. Plugin configuration is stored separately in `plugin_configs` (keyed by `plugin_instance_id` + `session_type_id`) and forwarded to the plugin in every call context. On `on_session_created`, the plugin resolves capabilities (e.g., by querying external services) and returns `Vec<Capability>` stored as `Session.enabled_capabilities`. On each message operation, Chat Engine calls the corresponding trait method and receives a `ResponseStream`. Plugins own all outbound communication — for example, the LLM gateway plugin makes HTTP requests to the Model Registry and LLM gateway service. Chat Engine does not interpret capability semantics, transport details, or external service protocols. Plugins may extend `PluginConfig.config` and `Message.metadata` with typed fields by registering GTS derived schemas — see `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-llm-gateway-plugin`.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Principle: Stream Everything

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-streaming`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-streaming-architecture`

All plugin responses are streamed by default to minimize time-to-first-byte. Plugins write chunks to a `ResponseStream` handle; Chat Engine pipes them directly to the client via HTTP chunked transfer with minimal buffering.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Principle: Zero Business Logic in Routing

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-zero-business-logic`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-routing-layer`

Chat Engine does not process, analyze, or transform message content. All business logic (content moderation, language detection, sentiment analysis) belongs in backend plugins. Chat Engine only routes, persists, and manages message trees.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

When principles conflict, the following priority applies (highest first): (1) Immutable Message Tree (data integrity), (2) Backend Plugin Authority (extensibility), (3) Stream Everything (responsiveness), (4) Zero Business Logic in Routing (scalability).

### 2.2 Constraints

#### Constraint: External File Storage

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-constraint-external-storage`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-file-handling`

Chat Engine does not store file content. Clients must upload files to File Storage Service and include file UUIDs (stable identifiers) in messages. File Storage Service provides separate API for accessing files by UUID. This constraint reduces infrastructure complexity and storage costs while enabling centralized access control.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Constraint: Single Database Instance

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-constraint-single-database`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-stateless-scaling`

All Chat Engine instances share a single database cluster. No local caching of session state or messages. This ensures consistency but limits scalability to database write throughput.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

Chat Engine manages session lifecycle operations including create, delete, and retrieve. It invokes the backend plugin with `session.created` event and stores returned capabilities. This functionality handles session type switching and share token generation.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Message Processing

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-tree-structure` (tree management), `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-variants` (variant assignment), `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-recreation` (recreation logic)

Chat Engine orchestrates message creation, persistence, and tree management. It validates parent references, assigns variant_index, and enforces tree constraints. Message processing integrates with plugin invocation functionality for backend communication.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Plugin Integration

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-routing-layer` (zero business logic), `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-plugin-backend-integration` (plugin system)

Chat Engine's plugin invocation layer. Resolves `dyn ChatEngineBackendPlugin` by `plugin_instance_id`, constructs call context, and invokes plugin methods (`on_session_type_configured`, `on_session_created`, `on_session_updated`, `on_message`, `on_message_recreate`, `on_session_summary`). On `on_session_created` and `on_session_updated`, the plugin returns `Vec<Capability>` stored as `Session.enabled_capabilities`. Auth, retry, circuit breaker, and timeouts are the plugin's responsibility.

**N:1 session type → plugin relationship**: Multiple differently-configured session types can share the same `plugin_instance_id`. Plugin configuration is stored separately in the `plugin_configs` table (keyed by `plugin_instance_id` + `session_type_id`). The call context always includes `session_type_id` and `plugin_config` (the `config` JSONB from the `plugin_configs` table), allowing a single plugin instance to serve multiple session types with different behaviour (e.g., different configuration, different capability set, different processing strategy).
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Response Streaming

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-streaming-architecture` (streaming architecture), `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-streaming-cancellation` (cancellation), `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-backpressure-handling` (backpressure)

Chat Engine manages HTTP chunked streaming functionality. It pipes data from backend plugin to client via HTTP streaming responses. This handles stateless request processing, partial response saving on connection close, and backpressure control. Each stream is identified by unique message_id.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Conversation Export

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Chat Engine provides conversation export functionality that traverses the message tree, formats content to JSON/Markdown/TXT, and uploads to file storage. Supports active path filtering and full tree export.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Message Search

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-search-strategy` (search strategy)

Chat Engine provides full-text search capabilities across messages. It implements session-scoped and cross-session search with ranking, pagination, and context window retrieval.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Message Reactions

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-reactions` (message reactions design)

Chat Engine allows users to react to messages with simple like/dislike feedback. Reactions are stored per-user per-message with UPSERT semantics, and backend plugins are notified via fire-and-forget `message.reaction` events.

**Key Features**:
- One reaction per user per message (can be changed or removed)
- UPSERT semantics: changing reaction overwrites previous
- HTTP API: `POST /messages/{id}/reaction` with `{reaction_type: "like"|"dislike"|"none"}`
- Plugin notification: `message.reaction` event sent to backend plugin after storage
- Fire-and-forget pattern: plugin notification failures don't affect client response
- Database: Composite primary key (message_id, user_id) ensures uniqueness
- Cascade delete: reactions removed when message is deleted
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

**Key Interactions**:
- Client → Chat Engine: Session and message operations via HTTP REST API
- Chat Engine → Backend Plugin: internal trait call with context (in-process)
- Chat Engine → Client: HTTP chunked streaming with NDJSON messages
- Chat Engine → File Storage: File upload with signed URL generation for exports
- Chat Engine → Database: All persistence operations for sessions, messages, and metadata
- Chat Engine → Summarization Service: Context summarization requests

### 3.2.1 Component Model

Chat Engine is deployed as a unified monolithic service. All functionality is implemented as internal modules within the same deployment unit. See Section 3.2 Architecture Overview for detailed module descriptions.

#### Chat Engine Service

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-service`

##### Why this component exists

Chat Engine Service is the top-level orchestrator that owns the session lifecycle and message routing pipeline, decoupling client applications from backend plugin implementations.

##### Responsibility scope

Persistence, routing, and message tree management. Chat Engine does not interpret message content.

##### Responsibility boundaries

Content moderation, AI processing, and summarization logic belong to backend plugins. File content storage belongs to File Storage Service. See `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-zero-business-logic`.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-actor-backend-plugin` — processes messages; called by Plugin Integration module
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-actor-file-storage` — stores file content; called by Conversation Export module
- `cpt-cf-chat-engine-actor-database` — persists all session and message state

#### Session Management Module

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-session-management`

Session lifecycle operations: create, delete, retrieve, type switching, share token generation. Invokes backend plugin with `on_session_created` trait method.

#### Message Processing Module

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-message-processing`

Message tree management: creation, persistence, parent validation, variant_index assignment, tree constraints. **ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-tree-structure`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-variants`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-recreation`.

#### Plugin Integration Module

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-webhook-integration`

Plugin registry and trait dispatch: resolves `dyn ChatEngineBackendPlugin` by `plugin_instance_id`, invokes trait methods (`on_session_created`, `on_session_updated`, `on_message`, etc.), delegates all transport/auth/retry to the plugin implementation. The first-party `webhook-compat` plugin wraps legacy HTTP webhook backends. **ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-plugin-backend-integration`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-routing-layer`.

#### Response Streaming Module

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-response-streaming`

HTTP chunked streaming: plugin-to-client pipe, backpressure control, connection cancellation, partial response saving. **ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-streaming-architecture`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-streaming-cancellation`, `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-backpressure-handling`.

#### Conversation Export Module

- [x] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-conversation-export`

Message tree traversal, format rendering (JSON/Markdown/TXT), file storage upload. Supports active path and full tree export.

#### Message Search Module

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-message-search`

Full-text search across messages: session-scoped and cross-session search, ranking, pagination, context window retrieval. **ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-search-strategy`.

#### Message Reactions Module

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-component-message-reactions`

Per-user per-message reactions with UPSERT semantics. Fire-and-forget plugin notification. Cascade delete on message removal. **ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-reactions`.

### 3.3 API Contracts

See [`api/README.md`](api/README.md) for comprehensive protocol documentation.

#### 3.3.1 HTTP REST API (Client ↔ Chat Engine)

**Specification**: [`api/http-protocol.json`](api/http-protocol.json) (OpenAPI 3.0.3)

**Base URL**: `https://chat-engine/api/v1`

**Authentication**: JWT Bearer token in Authorization header

**15 REST endpoints** across 3 categories:
- **Session Management (10)**: Create, get, delete, switch type, export, share, access shared, search, summarize (streaming)
- **Message Operations (5)**: Send (streaming), recreate (streaming), list, get, variants, reaction

**HTTP Streaming**:
- Content-Type: `application/x-ndjson` (newline-delimited JSON)
- Transfer-Encoding: chunked
- Cancellation: Close HTTP connection
- Events: start, chunk, complete, error

For complete endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, and examples, see the OpenAPI specification file.

#### 3.3.2 Plugin API (Chat Engine ↔ Backend Plugin)

**Interface**: `dyn ChatEngineBackendPlugin` (Rust trait, `chat-engine-sdk` crate)

**Discovery**: Plugin implementations are internal code modules registered in Chat Engine's plugin registry at startup by `plugin_instance_id`.

**Plugin methods**:
- `on_session_type_configured(ctx)` → `Vec<Capability>` — optional static capabilities stored as `SessionType.available_capabilities`; plugins may return empty and defer resolution to session creation
- `on_session_created(ctx)` → `Vec<Capability>` — capabilities resolved at session creation time, stored as `Session.enabled_capabilities`
- `on_session_updated(ctx)` → `Vec<Capability>` — called when user updates session capabilities; plugin re-resolves capabilities (e.g., model change triggers capability refresh from Model Registry), result overwrites `Session.enabled_capabilities`
- `on_message(ctx, stream)` → streams response chunks
- `on_message_recreate(ctx, stream)` → streams regenerated response
- `on_session_summary(ctx, stream)` → streams session summary
- `health_check()` → HealthStatus (optional)

**Streaming**: Plugin writes chunks to `ResponseStream`; Chat Engine pipes to client via HTTP chunked transfer (NDJSON)

### 3.5 Authorization Model

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-auth-model`

#### Authentication

All client requests require a valid JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. Chat Engine validates JWT signature and expiration, and extracts the `user_id` and `tenant_id` claims to establish request identity and tenant isolation.

#### Authorization Rules

| Resource | Operation | Requirement | Validation |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Session | Create | JWT valid | `user_id` from JWT becomes session owner; `tenant_id` scopes tenant isolation |
| Session | Read / Delete | JWT + ownership | `user_id` must match session `user_id` within same `tenant_id` |
| Message | Send | JWT + session ownership | Session must belong to `user_id` within same `tenant_id` |
| Message | Delete | JWT + ownership | Only message author can delete |
| Message | React | JWT + session access | Session must be accessible to `user_id` within same `tenant_id` |
| Shared session | Read | Share token | Valid non-expired share token required |
| Session type | Configure | Admin role | Elevated admin claim in JWT |

#### Inter-Service Authentication

Chat Engine does not manage authentication for plugin-to-external-service communication. Each backend plugin owns its outbound auth, retry, and transport configuration. For the `webhook-compat` plugin, webhook endpoint security (API keys, mTLS) is configured via plugin config and enforced by the plugin itself.

### 3.6 Data Protection

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-data-protection`

#### Personal Data Classification

| Data Type | Classification | Storage Location | Retention |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `client_id` | Pseudonymous identifier | Sessions, Messages | Session lifecycle |
| Message content | Potentially personal | Messages table | FR-020 retention policy |
| Session metadata | Potentially personal | Sessions table | Session lifecycle |
| File UUIDs | Reference only (not content) | Messages table | Session lifecycle |
| Reaction `user_id` | Pseudonymous identifier | Reactions table | Message lifecycle |
| Share tokens | Non-personal | Sessions table | Session lifecycle |

#### Data Erasure

- **Soft delete**: Marks session as `soft_deleted`; data preserved for recovery window
- **Hard delete**: Permanently removes session, messages, reactions, and metadata
- **Individual message deletion**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-delete-message` enables targeted erasure
- **Automated cleanup**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-fr-message-retention` for age-based or count-based cleanup

#### Data in Transit

All external communication requires TLS: Client ↔ Chat Engine (HTTPS), Plugin ↔ External Service (HTTPS, managed by plugin), Chat Engine ↔ Database (encrypted connection).

#### Data at Rest

Database-level encryption is an infrastructure concern configured at the database cluster level. Application-level field encryption is excluded (see Section 5: Intentional Exclusions).

### 3.7 Data Consistency

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-data-consistency`

#### Transaction Boundaries

| Operation | Scope | Isolation |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Message creation (send/recreate) | Single message INSERT + variant_index assignment | SERIALIZABLE on (session_id, parent_message_id) |
| Message subtree delete | Recursive CTE + DELETE reactions + DELETE messages | Single transaction, READ COMMITTED |
| Session soft/hard delete | Session UPDATE/DELETE + cascade messages + reactions | Single transaction |
| Reaction UPSERT | Single row INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE | Row-level lock on (message_id, user_id) |

#### Variant Index Concurrency

The UNIQUE constraint `(session_id, parent_message_id, variant_index)` requires safe concurrent variant_index assignment when multiple recreate or branch operations target the same parent message simultaneously.

**Strategy**: SELECT MAX(variant_index) + 1 within a serializable sub-transaction scoped to (session_id, parent_message_id). On constraint violation (concurrent race), retry with fresh MAX. Maximum 3 retries before returning 409 Conflict.

#### Idempotency

Message creation is not idempotent — each POST creates a new message node with a new UUID. Reaction UPSERT is idempotent by design (INSERT ON CONFLICT UPDATE).

All mutating endpoints accept an optional `Idempotency-Key` header. The server logs the key for deduplication auditing. Client SDKs SHOULD generate a UUID v4 per request.

### 3.8 Observability

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-observability`

#### Structured Logging

All request handling emits structured log events with the following fields: `trace_id`, `user_id`, `tenant_id`, `session_id`, `operation`, `duration_ms`, `status`. Message content and personal data are never logged.

#### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | HTTP latency by endpoint and status code |
| `plugin_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Plugin trait call latency by session_type_id |
| `active_streams` | Gauge | Concurrent streaming connections |
| `session_operations_total` | Counter | Session operations by type and result |

#### Health Endpoints

- `GET /health/live` — liveness probe (returns 200 if process is running)
- `GET /health/ready` — readiness probe (includes database connectivity check)

#### Distributed Tracing

`trace_id` is generated per request and propagated in all outbound calls (plugin invocation, database). Included in error responses for support correlation without exposing internal details.

### 3.9 Testing Architecture

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-testing-arch`

| Layer | Scope | Approach |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Unit | Domain logic, message tree operations, validation rules | Pure function tests, no I/O |
| Integration | Database operations, plugin integration | Real test database, mock plugin implementations |
| API | HTTP endpoints, streaming, auth | Test HTTP server, mock plugins, test database |
| Contract | Plugin API trait conformance | Schema-based tests against `ChatEngineBackendPlugin` trait contract |

Test isolation: each test case uses independent database state (transaction rollback or dedicated schema). Backend plugins are replaced by configurable mock implementations of `ChatEngineBackendPlugin`. Coverage targets: 90%+ for domain layer, 100% endpoint coverage including error paths and all authorization boundaries.

## 4. Additional Context

#### Context: Message Tree Traversal

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-tree-traversal`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-message-tree-structure` (tree structure)

Message tree traversal follows parent_message_id references. Active path is computed by following is_active = true flags from root. Full tree export requires recursive CTE queries to traverse all branches. Database indexes on parent_message_id are critical for performance.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Context: Plugin Resilience

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-circuit-breaker`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-plugin-backend-integration`

Per ADR-0022, resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry, timeout) are the responsibility of each backend plugin, not Chat Engine core. Chat Engine isolates plugin failures at the session level: a failing plugin does not affect other session types or other plugins. Plugins that communicate with external services (e.g., `webhook-compat`, LLM gateway) implement their own circuit breaker and retry logic internally.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Context: Streaming Backpressure

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-backpressure`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-backpressure-handling`

Streaming implementation uses bidirectional data streams with backpressure handling. If client is slow, Chat Engine buffers chunks in memory up to a configured limit. If the buffer fills, the webhook request is paused via flow control mechanisms. Client disconnect cancels the webhook request immediately.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Context: Search Performance

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-search`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-search-strategy`

Full-text search is implemented using database full-text search capabilities with inverted indexes on message content. Search is case-insensitive with language stemming. Results are ranked by relevance with document length normalization. Cross-session search is partitioned by tenant_id and user_id to prevent noisy neighbors. Pagination uses cursor-based queries for consistency.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Context: File Storage Integration

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-file-storage`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-adr-file-handling`

Chat Engine never stores file content. Clients upload directly to File Storage Service and receive stable UUID identifiers. Chat Engine stores file UUIDs (not URLs) in messages and forwards them to backend plugins. Webhook backends fetch files from File Storage Service using UUIDs. This approach provides stable identifiers, centralized access control, and enables transparent storage migration. File access is controlled through File Storage Service authentication, and clients request temporary signed URLs when displaying files.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Context: Session Type Configuration Security

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-security`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Plugin configuration (`plugin_configs.config` JSONB) may contain sensitive data (API keys, service URLs). Chat Engine treats plugin config as opaque and does not interpret its contents. Each plugin validates its own config against its registered GTS schema. Malicious backend plugins can return arbitrary content. Session type creation and plugin configuration should be restricted to admin users only.
<!-- fdd-id-content -->

#### Context: Error Response Security Pattern

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-error-security`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Error responses use the `ErrorDetails` schema to prevent leaking internal implementation details to clients. The schema enforces `additionalProperties: false` and defines explicit fields for each error scenario:

**Error Code to Details Mapping**:
- `INVALID_REQUEST` → validation_errors (field-level validation failures)
- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` → retry_after_seconds, limit_type, quota_reset_at
- `BACKEND_TIMEOUT` → timeout_ms
- `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` / `MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND` → resource_id (UUID format only)
- `AUTH_REQUIRED` / `BACKEND_ERROR` / `INTERNAL_ERROR` → trace_id only (for support correlation)

**Security Constraints**:
- No arbitrary data allowed in error details (prevents stack trace leaks)
- trace_id limited to alphanumeric characters (no file paths or SQL fragments)
- resource_id validated as UUID format only
- Sensitive debugging information (stack traces, database errors, internal paths) must only appear in secure internal logs

This pattern follows RFC 9457 (Problem Details) and ensures compliance with security requirements for user-facing errors while maintaining full debugging capability through internal logging.

#### Context: Capacity Planning

**ID**: `cpt-cf-chat-engine-design-context-capacity-planning`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
Translating PRD targets into infrastructure estimates: 10,000 concurrent sessions requires approximately 10K persistent database connections (mitigated with connection pooling, e.g., PgBouncer) and approximately 2GB of active memory for stream buffers (assuming ~200KB per active stream). A throughput target of 1,000 messages per second translates to approximately 100 write IOPS (batched inserts) and approximately 1TB per year of storage growth at an average of 1KB per message (content + metadata). These estimates assume the single-database constraint (`cpt-cf-chat-engine-constraint-single-database`) and should be revisited if sharding is introduced.

| **Content Safety** | Content moderation, toxicity filtering | Delegated to backend plugins (Principle: Zero Business Logic in Routing — `cpt-cf-chat-engine-principle-zero-business-logic`) |
| **Accessibility** | UI/UX accessibility requirements | Backend service; client application responsibility |
| **Internationalization** | Multi-language UI, locale handling | Not applicable; message content is opaque to Chat Engine |
| **Rate Limiting** | Throttling algorithms, quota management | Handled at API gateway layer upstream of Chat Engine |
| **Application Caching** | In-process or distributed cache | Excluded per `cpt-cf-chat-engine-constraint-single-database` |
| **Message Encryption** | Application-level field encryption | Infrastructure-level database encryption handles data-at-rest |
