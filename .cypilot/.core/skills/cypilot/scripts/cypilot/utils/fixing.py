"""Enrichment utilities for validation output: fixing prompts for LLM agents.

Each validation error/warning gets a ``fixing_prompt`` — a concise, actionable
instruction that an LLM agent can follow to resolve the issue.  The prompt
includes the clickable ``location`` (PATH:LINE), the affected ID, and relevant
constraint context (SYSTEM, KIND, template).
