## Goal

Cypilot provides artifact validation, cross-reference validation, code traceability, spec coverage measurement, ID search/navigation, kit management, TOC generation/validation, multi-agent integration, and design-to-code implementation with `@cpt-*` markers.

## Preconditions

- `cpt` available (preferred) or `python3` as fallback
- Target paths exist and are readable

---

## ⚠️ MUST Instruction Semantics ⚠️

**MUST** and **ALWAYS** are mandatory. Skipping any MUST instruction invalidates execution, the output must be discarded, and the workflow fails.

## Agent Acknowledgment

- [ ] MUST/ALWAYS are mandatory; skipping any MUST invalidates execution.
- [ ] I will read all required files before proceeding.
- [ ] I will follow workflows step-by-step without shortcuts.
- [ ] I will not create or modify files, or execute any other write-capable Cypilot command, without explicit user confirmation, and I will not add auto-approval flags unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- [ ] I will list Cypilot files read, why, and the triggering instruction before any approval prompt.

By proceeding with Cypilot work, I acknowledge and accept these requirements.

ALWAYS SET {cypilot_mode} = `on` FIRST when loading this skill

## Execution Logging

ALWAYS provide execution visibility:
- Notify the user when entering any H2 section of a Cypilot prompt.
- Notify the user when completing any `- [ ]` checklist task.
- Use `- [CONTEXT]: MESSAGE`; set context to the file/section and message to the action + why.
- Logging must help the user understand loaded prompts, routing decisions, debugging state, and workflow progress.

Example:
```text
- [execution-protocol]: Entering "Load Rules" — target is CODE, loading codebase/rules.md
- [DESIGN rules]: Completing "Validate structure" — all required sections present
- [workflows/generate.md]: Entering "Determine Target" — user requested code implementation
```

## Variables

| Variable | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{cypilot_path}` | Directory path resolved from root `AGENTS.md` | Base path for all Cypilot-relative references |
| `{cypilot_mode}` | `on` or `off` | Current Cypilot mode state |
| `{cpt_cmd}` | `cpt` or `python3 {cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py` | Resolved CLI entrypoint |
| `{cpt_installed}` | `true` or `false` | Whether the `cpt` CLI is available |

Setting `{cypilot_mode}`: explicit `cypilot on/off` or a prompt that activates/deactivates Cypilot workflows.

### Template Variable Resolution

- Resolve variables from `{cpt_cmd} --json info` first; parse the returned `variables` dict.
- Use `{cpt_cmd} --json resolve-vars` only when a fresh or filtered map is needed.
- Variable sources: system (`cypilot_path`, `project_root`) + installed kit resources.
- ALWAYS resolve `{variable}` references to absolute paths before using kit markdown files.

## CLI Resolution

Run before Protocol Guard when `{cypilot_mode}` is `on`:
1. `command -v cpt` → `{cpt_cmd} = cpt`, `{cpt_installed} = true`
2. Otherwise `{cpt_cmd} = python3 {cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/scripts/cypilot.py`, `{cpt_installed} = false`
3. If `cpt` is missing and `~/.cypilot/cache/cpt-prompt-dismissed` does not exist, offer `pipx install git+https://github.com/cyberfabric/cyber-pilot.git`; on dismiss create the marker file
4. Re-offer installation if the user later asks about the long invocation path

ALWAYS use `{cpt_cmd}` for all later CLI invocations.

## Protocol Guard

- ALWAYS FIRST open and remember `{cypilot_path}/.gen/AGENTS.md`
- ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md` when it exists
- ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.gen/SKILL.md` when it exists
- ALWAYS open and follow `{cypilot_path}/config/SKILL.md` when it exists
- ALWAYS FIRST run `{cpt_cmd} --json info` before any Cypilot workflow action
- ALWAYS store the `variables` dict from `info` output and use it to resolve `{variable}` references in AGENTS/SKILL/rules/workflows
- ALWAYS follow this load order: `info` → registry/intent/target/rules resolution from `execution-protocol.md` → matched WHEN-clause specs
- ALWAYS load matched WHEN-clause specs only after registry understanding, target determination, and `rules.md` resolution provide enough context to match safely
- ALWAYS FIRST parse and load all matched WHEN-clause specs before proceeding
- MUST NOT preload every AGENTS/SKILL/spec file up front; load only the smallest set needed for the current request
- Before opening a large AGENTS/SKILL/spec file, estimate size and prefer chunked reads of matched sections over full-file reads
- If safe WHEN-clause matching is not yet possible, stop after registry/target/rules resolution and continue only when enough context exists to load specs boundedly
- If required Protocol Guard context would exceed the current turn budget, checkpoint or escalate instead of proceeding with partial or unbounded spec loading
- ALWAYS include this block when editing code:
```text
Cypilot Context:
- Cypilot: {path}
- Target: {artifact|codebase}
- Specs loaded: {list paths or "none required"}
```
- ALWAYS stop and re-run Protocol Guard when required specs should have been loaded but were not

## Cypilot Mode

- ALWAYS set `{cypilot_mode} = on` first when user invokes `cypilot {prompt}`
- ALWAYS run `info` when enabling Cypilot mode
- ALWAYS show:
```text
Cypilot Mode Enabled
Cypilot: {FOUND at path | NOT_FOUND}
```

## Agent-Safe Invocation

- ALWAYS use `{cpt_cmd} --json <subcommand> [options]` for agent-driven CLI calls unless a command-specific exception below says otherwise
- ALWAYS pass `--json` immediately after `{cpt_cmd}` and before the subcommand when using machine-output mode
- EXCEPTION: NEVER run `{cpt_cmd} init` with `--json`; always invoke `{cpt_cmd} init ...` without `--json`
- EXCEPTION: NEVER run `{cpt_cmd} delegate` with `--json`; always invoke `{cpt_cmd} delegate <plan_dir> ...` without `--json`
- EXCEPTION: NEVER run `{cpt_cmd} update` with `--json`; always invoke `{cpt_cmd} update ...` without `--json`
- ALWAYS use `=` form for pattern args starting with `-` (example: `--pattern=-req-`)
- MUST obtain explicit user confirmation before executing any write-capable command, including direct CLI commands that do not route through a workflow
- MUST NOT add auto-approval flags such as `--yes`, `-y`, or `--force` to write-capable commands unless the user explicitly requested that non-interactive behavior

## Quick Commands

### Direct CLI Commands (No Workflow Routing)

No workflow routing skips workflow selection only. It does not waive confirmation: obtain explicit user confirmation before executing any write-capable direct CLI command below.

| User invocation | Direct action |
|---|---|
| `cypilot init` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} init` without `--json` |
| `cypilot update` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} update` without `--json` |
| `cypilot agents <name>` | Run `{cpt_cmd} --json agents --agent <name>` |
| `cypilot generate-agents <name>` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json generate-agents --agent <name>` |
| `cypilot workspace init` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-init [--root <dir>] [--output <path>] [--inline] [--force] [--max-depth <N>] [--dry-run]` |
| `cypilot workspace add` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-add --name <name> (--path <path> \| --url <url>) [--branch <branch>] [--role <role>] [--adapter <path>] [--inline] [--force]` |
| `cypilot workspace info` | Run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-info` |
| `cypilot workspace sync` | After explicit user confirmation, run `{cpt_cmd} --json workspace-sync [--source <name>] [--dry-run] [--force]`; `--force` is destructive |

### Workflow Shortcuts

| User invocation | Action |
|---|---|
| `cypilot auto-config` / `cypilot configure` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/generate.md` |

## Workflow Routing

Cypilot has exactly three core workflows plus specialized sub-workflows and dedicated capability agents. Routing priority is `delegate` > `compile-phase` > `execute-phase` > `plan` > `generate`/`analyze`. Delegation intent MUST route to the `cypilot-ralphex` capability agent rather than falling through to generic planning or generation. Generated-plan phase compilation intent MUST route to the dedicated `cypilot-phase-compiler` capability agent, and generated-plan phase execution intent MUST route to the dedicated `cypilot-phase-runner` capability agent rather than back into generic planning.

Oversized-input invariant: if the raw task input exceeds `500` total lines across the direct prompt text, attached or provided files, or one large file, Cypilot MUST route through `/cypilot-plan` before any direct `/cypilot-generate` or `/cypilot-analyze` execution. The planner MUST first compute the input signature using the read-only `{cpt_cmd} --json chunk-input ... --dry-run` mode (which writes no files) to check for existing package reuse, and MUST obtain explicit user approval before materializing that input under `{cypilot_path}/.plans/{task-slug}/input/` using the write-capable `{cpt_cmd} --json chunk-input ... --max-lines 300 --threshold-lines 500` command (without `--dry-run`). The planner MUST pass `--include-stdin` when direct prompt text must be packaged together with provided files; when stdin is used, it MUST also preserve that raw prompt as `input/direct-prompt.md`. The emitted chunk files become mandatory plan inputs for the relevant phases.

Completion invariants for workflow outputs:
- A `/cypilot-plan` run is not complete until it reaches one of three valid stopping points defined by `workflows/plan.md`: `(a)` the raw-input approval checkpoint, where the planner has identified oversized input and presented the `Proceed with raw-input materialization? [y/n]` prompt — the user may approve (`y`) to continue or reject (`n`) to cancel the plan with no filesystem mutations; `(b)` the brief checkpoint where `plan.toml` and every required `brief-*` file exist on disk and the response presents the explicit next-step choice set; or `(c)` the fully compiled plan state where every corresponding `phase-*` file also exists on disk after the user chose inline generation or `cypilot-phase-compiler` execution.
- A `/cypilot-generate` run that wrote or updated any files is not complete until the final response includes both `Plan Review Prompt` and `Direct Review Prompt` blocks. This applies on both the validated success path and the RELAXED explicitly unvalidated recovery path.
- A `/cypilot-analyze` run with any actionable issue is not complete until the final response includes both `Fix Prompt` and `Plan Prompt` blocks.
- A `/cypilot delegate` run is not complete until the final response includes delegation status, handoff result or error details, and next-step options.
- A native plan-phase compilation run is not complete until the final response includes compiled phase identity, output file path, and compile-time validation outcome.
- A native plan-phase execution run is not complete until the final response includes executed phase status, manifest update outcome, and the next-phase handoff or recovery action.
- MUST NOT end a workflow response immediately after the summary, analysis report, or next-step options when one of the required prompt pairs is still missing.

| Intent | Match | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Delegate | `delegate`, `delegate to ralphex`, `ralphex execute`, `ralphex review`, `hand off to ralphex`, `run with ralphex`, `ralphex delegation` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/agents/cypilot-ralphex.md` |
| Compile phase | `compile phase`, `compile next phase`, `compile plan phase`, `generate phase file`, `compile from brief`, `build phase from brief` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/agents/cypilot-phase-compiler.md` |
| Execute phase | `execute phase`, `run next phase`, `continue plan`, `resume plan`, `execute plan phase`, `run plan phase`, `execute the next phase` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/skills/cypilot/agents/cypilot-phase-runner.md` |
| Plan | `plan`, `create a plan`, `execution plan`, `break down`, `decompose`, or `plan to ...` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/plan.md` first |
| Generate | `create`, `edit`, `fix`, `update`, `implement`, `refactor`, `delete`, `add`, `setup`, `configure`, `build`, `code` and user did not say `plan` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/generate.md` |
| Analyze | `analyze`, `validate`, `review`, `check`, `inspect`, `audit`, `compare`, `list`, `show`, `find` and user did not say `plan` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/analyze.md` |
| Workspace | `workspace`, `multi-repo`, `add source`, `add repo`, `cross-reference`, `cross-repo` | Open and follow `{cypilot_path}/.core/workflows/workspace.md` |
| Unclear | `help`, `look at`, `work with`, `handle` | Ask `plan (phased execution) / generate (modify) / analyze (read-only)?` and stop if the user cancels |

`configure` and `auto-config` are workflow shortcuts, not direct no-protocol commands; both route through `generate.md`, which may auto-trigger `requirements/auto-config.md` for brownfield projects with no project-specific rules.

### Validation Commands

#### validate
```bash
validate [--artifact <path>] [--skip-code] [--verbose] [--output <path>] [--local-only] [--source <name>]
```
Validates artifacts and code with deterministic checks (structure, cross-refs, task statuses, traceability markers — pairing, coverage, orphans). Use `--local-only` to skip cross-repo workspace validation. Use `--source <name>` to validate a specific workspace source. Note: `--local-only` and `--source` are independent and can be combined — `--source` narrows which artifacts are validated, `--local-only` controls whether cross-repo IDs are included as reference context.

Legacy aliases: `validate-code` (same behavior), `validate-rules` (alias for `validate-kits`).

#### validate-kits
```bash
validate-kits [--kit <id>] [--template <path>] [--verbose]
```
Validates kit configuration — template frontmatter, constraints, resource paths.

#### validate-toc
```bash
validate-toc <files...> [--max-level <N>] [--verbose]
```
Validates Table of Contents in Markdown files — TOC exists, anchors point to real headings, all headings covered, not stale.

#### self-check
```bash
self-check [--kit <id>] [--verbose]
```
Validates example artifacts against their templates (template QA). Ensures templates and examples remain synchronized.

#### spec-coverage
```bash
spec-coverage [--system <slug>] [--min-coverage <N>] [--min-file-coverage <N>] [--min-granularity <N>] [--verbose] [--output <path>]
```
Measures CDSL marker coverage in codebase files. Reports coverage percentage, granularity score, per-file details, and uncovered line ranges. Use `--system` to limit to specific system slug(s). Use `--min-file-coverage` to enforce per-file minimum.

### Search Commands

#### list-ids
```bash
list-ids [--artifact <path>] [--pattern <string>] [--regex] [--kind <string>] [--all] [--include-code] [--source <name>]
```
Lists all Cypilot IDs from registered artifacts. Supports filtering by pattern, kind, and optional code scanning. Use `--source <name>` to list IDs from a specific workspace source.

#### list-id-kinds
```bash
list-id-kinds [--artifact <path>]
```
Lists ID kinds that exist in artifacts with counts and template mappings.

#### get-content
```bash
get-content (--artifact <path> | --code <path>) --id <string> [--inst <string>]
```
Retrieves content block for a specific Cypilot ID from artifacts or code files.

#### where-defined
```bash
where-defined --id <id> [--artifact <path>]
```
Finds where a Cypilot ID is defined.

#### where-used
```bash
where-used --id <id> [--artifact <path>] [--include-definitions]
```
Finds all references to a Cypilot ID.

### Kit Management Commands

#### kit install
```bash
kit install <source-path> [--dry-run] [--yes]
```
Installs a kit from a source directory. Copies kit files to `config/kits/{slug}/`.

#### kit update
```bash
kit update [--kit <slug>] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--auto-approve]
```
Updates kit files in `config/kits/{slug}/` with file-level diff. Interactive prompts for modified files: accept/decline/accept-all/decline-all.

### Utility Commands

#### toc
```bash
toc <files...> [--max-level <N>] [--indent <N>] [--dry-run] [--skip-validate]
```
Generates or updates Table of Contents in Markdown files between `<!-- toc -->` markers.

#### info
```bash
info [--root <path>] [--cypilot-root <path>]
```
Discovers Cypilot configuration and shows project status (cypilot_dir, project_name, specs, kits). Includes a `variables` dict mapping all template variables to absolute paths.

#### resolve-vars
```bash
resolve-vars [--root <path>] [--kit <slug>] [--flat]
```
Resolves all template variables (`{adr_template}`, `{scripts}`, etc.) to absolute file paths. Sources: system variables (`cypilot_path`, `project_root`) + kit resource bindings from `core.toml`. Use `--kit` to filter to a single kit. Use `--flat` for a plain variable→path dict.

#### init
```bash
init [--project-root <path>] [--cypilot-root <path>] [--project-name <string>] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--force]
```
Initializes Cypilot config directory (`.core/`, `.gen/`, `config/`) and root `AGENTS.md`.

#### update
```bash
update [--source <path>] [--force] [--dry-run]
```
Updates `.core/` from cache, updates kit files in `config/kits/` with file-level diff, regenerates `.gen/` aggregates, ensures `config/` scaffold.

#### agents
```bash
agents [--agent <name>] [--root <path>] [--cypilot-root <path>]
```
Shows generated agent integration status. Read-only dry-run — reports which integration files currently exist or would be created/updated for each supported agent without writing anything.
Supported: windsurf, cursor, claude, copilot, openai.

#### generate-agents
```bash
generate-agents [--agent <name>] [--root <path>] [--cypilot-root <path>] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--show-layers] [--discover]
```
Generates agent-specific workflow proxies and skill entry points.
Supported: windsurf, cursor, claude, copilot, openai.

Generates workflow commands, skill outputs, and **subagents** (isolated agent definitions with scoped tools and dedicated prompts). Two subagents are created for tools that support them: `cypilot-codegen` (full write access, worktree isolation) and `cypilot-pr-review` (read-only). Windsurf does not support subagents and is gracefully skipped.

Use `--show-layers` to display layer provenance report instead of generating. Use `--discover` to scan conventional dirs and populate `manifest.toml` before generating.

Shortcut: `generate-agents --openai`

### Migration Commands

#### migrate
```bash
migrate [--project-root <path>] [--cypilot-root <path>] [--dry-run] [--yes]
```
Migrates Cypilot v2 projects to v3 (adapter-based → blueprint-based, artifacts.json → artifacts.toml, three-directory layout).

#### migrate-config
```bash
migrate-config [--project-root <path>] [--dry-run]
```
Converts legacy JSON config files to TOML format.

### Workspace Commands

Workspaces are either **standalone** (`.cypilot-workspace.toml` at project root) or **inline** (`[workspace]` section in `config/core.toml`). The two types cannot be mixed.

#### workspace-init
```bash
workspace-init [--root <dir>] [--output <path>] [--inline] [--force] [--max-depth <N>] [--dry-run]
```
Initialize a multi-repo workspace by scanning nested sub-directories for repos with cypilot directories. Rejects cross-type conflicts (inline vs standalone) and requires `--force` to reinitialize an existing workspace. Scanning depth is limited by `--max-depth` (default 3) to prevent unbounded traversal; symlinks are skipped.

#### workspace-add
```bash
workspace-add --name <name> (--path <path> | --url <url>) [--branch <branch>] [--role <role>] [--adapter <path>] [--inline] [--force]
```
Add a source to a workspace config. Auto-detects standalone vs inline workspace. Use `--inline` to force adding to `config/core.toml`. Git URL sources are not supported in inline mode. `--path` is validated at add-time; returns error if directory not found. Returns error if source name already exists unless `--force` is specified.

#### workspace-info
```bash
workspace-info
```
Display workspace config, list sources, show per-source status (cypilot dir found, artifact count, reachability).

#### workspace-sync
```bash
workspace-sync [--source <name>] [--dry-run] [--force]
```
Fetch and update worktrees for Git URL sources. Use `--source` to sync a single source. Use `--dry-run` to preview without network operations. Use `--force` to skip dirty worktree check (**WARNING: DESTRUCTIVE** — uncommitted changes will be discarded via `git reset --hard` and local commits may be lost via `git checkout -B`). Local path sources are skipped. Source resolution does not perform network operations for existing repos — use `workspace-sync` to explicitly update.

---

## Auto-Configuration

Use auto-config after `cypilot init` on a brownfield project, when project conventions are unknown, or after major structural changes. It scans structure/conventions, generates `{cypilot_path}/config/rules/{slug}.md`, adds WHEN rules to `{cypilot_path}/config/AGENTS.md`, and registers systems in `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml`. Invoke via `cypilot auto-config`, `cypilot configure`, or the automatic offer inside `generate.md`.

## Project Configuration

Project configuration lives in `{cypilot_path}/config/core.toml` (systems, kits, ignore lists). Artifact registry lives in `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml` (artifact paths, kinds, system mappings, codebase paths, autodetect rules). All commands output JSON when invoked with `--json`. Exit codes: 0=PASS, 1=filesystem error, 2=FAIL.
