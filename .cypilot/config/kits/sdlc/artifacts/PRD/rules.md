## Requirements

### Structural

**Load on demand**: `{prd_template}` — WHEN validating structure

- [ ] PRD follows `{prd_template}` structure
- [ ] Artifact frontmatter (optional): use `cpt:` format for document metadata
- [ ] All required sections present and non-empty
- [ ] All IDs follow `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-{kind}-{slug}` convention
- [ ] All capabilities have priority markers (`p1`–`p9`)
- [ ] No placeholder content (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- [ ] No duplicate IDs within document

### Versioning

- [ ] When editing existing PRD: increment version in frontmatter
- [ ] When changing capability definition: add `-v{N}` suffix to ID or increment existing version
  - Format: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-cap-{slug}-v2`, `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-cap-{slug}-v3`, etc.
- [ ] Keep changelog of significant changes

### Semantic

**Load on demand**: `{prd_checklist}` — WHEN checking semantic quality

- [ ] Purpose MUST be ≤ 2 paragraphs
- [ ] Purpose MUST NOT contain implementation details
- [ ] Vision MUST explain WHY the product exists
  - VALID: "Enables developers to validate artifacts against templates" (explains purpose)
  - INVALID: "A tool for Cypilot" (doesn't explain why it matters)
- [ ] Background MUST describe current state and specific pain points
- [ ] MUST include target users and key problems solved
- [ ] All goals MUST be measurable with concrete targets
  - VALID: "Reduce validation time from 15min to <30s" (quantified with baseline)
  - INVALID: "Improve validation speed" (no baseline, no target)
- [ ] Success criteria MUST include baseline, target, and timeframe
- [ ] All actors MUST be identified with specific roles (not just "users")
  - VALID: "Framework Developer", "Project Maintainer", "CI Pipeline"
  - INVALID: "Users", "Developers" (too generic)
- [ ] Each actor MUST have defined capabilities/needs
- [ ] Actor IDs follow: `cpt-{system}-actor-{slug}`
- [ ] Non-goals MUST explicitly state what product does NOT do
- [ ] Every FR MUST use observable behavior language (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD)
- [ ] Every FR MUST have a unique ID: `cpt-{system}-fr-{slug}`
- [ ] Every FR MUST have a priority marker (`p1`–`p9`)
- [ ] Every FR MUST have a rationale explaining business value
- [ ] Every FR MUST reference at least one actor
- [ ] Capabilities MUST trace to business problems
- [ ] No placeholder content (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- [ ] No duplicate IDs within document
- [ ] All requirements verified via automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) targeting 90%+ code coverage unless otherwise specified

- [ ] Use case IDs follow: `cpt-{system}-usecase-{slug}`
- [ ] Key assumptions MUST be explicitly stated
- [ ] Open questions MUST have owners and target resolution dates
- [ ] Risks and uncertainties MUST be documented with impact and mitigation

### Traceability

**Load on demand**: `{cypilot_path}/.core/architecture/specs/traceability.md` — WHEN checking ID formats

- [ ] Capabilities traced through: PRD → DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → FEATURE → CODE
- [ ] When capability fully implemented (all specs IMPLEMENTED) → mark capability `[x]`
- [ ] When all capabilities `[x]` → product version complete

### Constraints

**Load on demand**:
- `{constraints}` — WHEN validating cross-references
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/architecture/specs/kit/constraints.md` — WHEN resolving constraint rules

- [ ] ALWAYS open and follow `{constraints}` (kit root)
- [ ] Treat `constraints.toml` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/requirements/kit-constraints.md`
- `{cypilot_path}/.core/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `identifiers[<kind>].references` rules (required / optional / prohibited)
- `cypilot validate` enforces headings scoping for ID definitions and references
- `cypilot validate` enforces "checked ref implies checked def" consistency

### Deliberate Omissions (MUST NOT HAVE)

PRDs must NOT contain the following — report as violation if found:

- **ARCH-PRD-NO-001**: No Technical Implementation Details (CRITICAL) — PRD captures *what*, not *how*
- **ARCH-PRD-NO-002**: No Architectural Decisions (CRITICAL) — decisions belong in ADR
- **BIZ-PRD-NO-001**: No Implementation Tasks (HIGH) — tasks belong in DECOMPOSITION
- **BIZ-PRD-NO-002**: No Spec-Level Design (HIGH) — specs belong in FEATURE
- **DATA-PRD-NO-001**: No Data Schema Definitions (HIGH) — schemas belong in DESIGN
- **INT-PRD-NO-001**: No API Specifications (HIGH) — API specs belong in DESIGN/FEATURE
- **TEST-PRD-NO-001**: No Test Cases (MEDIUM) — tests belong in FEATURE/code
- **OPS-PRD-NO-001**: No Infrastructure Specifications (MEDIUM) — infra belongs in DESIGN
- **SEC-PRD-NO-001**: No Security Implementation Details (HIGH) — implementation belongs in DESIGN/code
- **MAINT-PRD-NO-001**: No Code-Level Documentation (MEDIUM) — code docs belong in code

---

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] Read project config for ID prefix
- [ ] Identify artifact output path from `{cypilot_path}/config/artifacts.toml`

### Phase 2: Content Creation

**Load on demand**:
- `{prd_template}` — WHEN generating artifact structure
- `{prd_example}` — WHEN needing reference for content depth

- [ ] Write each section guided by template prompts and examples
- [ ] Use example as reference for content depth:
  - Vision → how example explains purpose (BIZ-PRD-001)
  - Actors → how example defines actors (BIZ-PRD-002)
  - Capabilities → how example structures caps (BIZ-PRD-003)
  - Use Cases → how example documents journeys (BIZ-PRD-004)
  - NFRs + Exclusions → how example handles N/A categories (DOC-PRD-001)
  - Non-Goals & Risks → how example scopes product (BIZ-PRD-008)
  - Assumptions → how example states assumptions (BIZ-PRD-007)

### Phase 3: IDs and Structure

- [ ] Generate actor IDs: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-actor-{slug}` (e.g., `cpt-myapp-actor-admin-user`)
- [ ] Generate capability IDs: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-fr-{slug}` (e.g., `cpt-myapp-fr-user-management`)
- [ ] Assign priorities based on business impact
- [ ] Verify uniqueness with `cypilot list-ids`

### Phase 4: Quality Check

- [ ] Compare output quality to `{prd_example}`
- [ ] Self-review against `{prd_checklist}` MUST HAVE items
- [ ] Ensure no MUST NOT HAVE violations

### Phase 5: Table of Contents

- [ ] Run `cypilot toc <artifact-file>` to generate/update Table of Contents
- [ ] Verify TOC is present and complete with `cypilot validate-toc <artifact-file>`

---

## Validation

### Phase 1: Structural Validation (Deterministic)

- [ ] Run `cypilot validate --artifact <path>` for:
  - Template structure compliance
  - ID format validation
  - Priority markers present
  - No placeholders
  - No duplicate IDs

### Phase 2: Semantic Validation (Checklist-based)

**Load on demand**: `{prd_checklist}` — required for this phase

- [ ] Read `{prd_checklist}` in full
- [ ] For each MUST HAVE item: check if requirement is met
  - If not met: report as violation with severity
  - If not applicable: verify explicit "N/A" with reasoning
- [ ] For each MUST NOT HAVE item: scan document for violations
- [ ] Compare content depth to `{prd_example}`
  - Flag significant quality gaps

### Phase 3: Validation Report

```
PRD Validation Report
═════════════════════

Structural: PASS/FAIL
Semantic: PASS/FAIL (N issues)

Issues:
- [SEVERITY] CHECKLIST-ID: Description
```

### Phase 4: Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the product's domain** — What kind of product is this PRD for? (e.g., consumer app, enterprise platform, developer tool, internal system)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all PRDs:
   - An internal tool PRD may not need market positioning analysis
   - A developer framework PRD may not need end-user personas
   - A methodology PRD may not need regulatory compliance analysis

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

For each major checklist category (BIZ, ARCH, SEC, TEST, MAINT), confirm:

- [ ] Category is addressed in the document, OR
- [ ] Category is explicitly marked "Not applicable" with reasoning, OR
- [ ] Category absence is reported as a violation (with applicability justification)

### Phase 5: Review Priority

**Review Priority**: BIZ → ARCH → SEC → TEST → (others as applicable)

> **New in v1.2**: Safety was added as a distinct quality characteristic in ISO/IEC 25010:2023. Applicable for systems that could cause harm to people, property, or the environment.

### Phase 6: Report Format

Report **only** problems (do not list what is OK).

For each issue include:

- **Why Applicable**: Explain why this requirement applies to this specific PRD's context
- **Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}
- **Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW
- **Issue**: What is wrong (requirement missing or incomplete)
- **Evidence**: Quote the exact text or "No mention found"
- **Why it matters**: Impact (risk, cost, user harm, compliance)
- **Proposal**: Concrete fix with clear acceptance criteria

```markdown
## Review Report (Issues Only)

### 1. {Short issue title}

**Checklist Item**: `{CHECKLIST-ID}` — {Checklist item title}

**Severity**: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW

#### Why Applicable

{Explain why this requirement applies to this PRD's context}

#### Issue

{What is wrong}

#### Evidence

{Quote or "No mention found"}

#### Why It Matters

{Impact}

#### Proposal

{Concrete fix}
```

### Phase 7: Reporting Commitment

- [ ] I reported all issues I found
- [ ] I used the exact report format defined in this checklist (no deviations)
- [ ] I included Why Applicable justification for each issue
- [ ] I included evidence and impact for each issue
- [ ] I proposed concrete fixes for each issue
- [ ] I did not hide or omit known problems
- [ ] I verified explicit handling for all major checklist categories
- [ ] I am ready to iterate on the proposals and re-review after changes

### Phase 8: PR Review Focus (Requirements)

When reviewing PRs that add or change PRD/requirements documents, additionally focus on:

- [ ] Completeness and clarity of requirements
- [ ] Testability and acceptance criteria for every requirement
- [ ] Traceability to business goals and stated problems
- [ ] Compliance with `{prd_template}` structure
- [ ] Alignment with best industry standard practices for large SaaS systems and platforms
- [ ] Critical assessment of requirements quality — challenge vague, overlapping, or untestable items
- [ ] Split findings by checklist category and rate each 1-10
- [ ] Ensure requirements are aligned with the project's existing architecture (see DESIGN artifacts)

### Phase 9: Table of Contents Validation

- [ ] Table of Contents section exists (`## Table of Contents` or `<!-- toc -->` markers)
- [ ] All TOC anchors point to actual headings in the document
- [ ] All headings are represented in the TOC
- [ ] TOC order matches document heading order
- [ ] Run `cypilot validate-toc <artifact-file>` — must report PASS

---

## Error Handling

### Missing Dependencies

- [ ] If `{prd_template}` cannot be loaded → STOP, cannot proceed without template
- [ ] If `{prd_checklist}` cannot be loaded → warn user, skip semantic validation
- [ ] If `{prd_example}` cannot be loaded → warn user, continue with reduced guidance

### Missing Adapter

### Escalation

- [ ] Ask user when cannot determine appropriate actor roles for the domain
- [ ] Ask user when business requirements are unclear or contradictory
- [ ] Ask user when success criteria cannot be quantified without domain knowledge
- [ ] Ask user when uncertain whether a category is truly N/A or just missing

### Missing Config

- [ ] If project config unavailable → use default project prefix `cpt-{dirname}`
- [ ] Ask user to confirm or provide custom prefix

---

## Next Steps

### Options

- [ ] PRD complete → `/cypilot-generate DESIGN` — create technical design
- [ ] Need architecture decision → `/cypilot-generate ADR` — document key decision
- [ ] PRD needs revision → continue editing PRD
- [ ] Want checklist review only → `/cypilot-analyze semantic` — semantic validation
